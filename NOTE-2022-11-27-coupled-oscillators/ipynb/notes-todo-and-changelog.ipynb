    " - So far everything looks perfect -- I really like this model.  It fits every observable thing that we are seeing.  \n",
    " - I think that the only remaining thing to include is loss on the transmission line. \n",
    " - That could be loss that is due to the bend and radiation, as well as loss that is on the line\n",
    " - For this I should make it purely phenomenological\n",
    " - One difference I should keep in mind between this model and experiment (why it will never be 1-1 correspondence) is that in the experiment there is an extended network of these connections!"
