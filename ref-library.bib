  abstract = {The use of electron mirrors in aberration correction and surface-sensitive microscopy techniques such as low-energy electron microscopy has been established. However, in this work, by implementing an easy to construct, fully electrostatic electron mirror system under a sample in a conventional scanning electron microscope (SEM), we present a new imaging scheme which allows us to form scanned images of the top and bottom surfaces of the sample simultaneously. We believe that this imaging scheme could be of great value to the field of in-situ SEM which has been limited to observation of dynamic changes such as crack propagation and other surface phenomena on one side of samples at a time. We analyze the image properties when using a flat versus a concave electron mirror system and discuss two different regimes of operation. In addition to in-situ SEM, we foresee that our imaging scheme could open up avenues towards spherical aberration correction by the use of electron mirrors in SEMs without the need for complex beam separators.},

A simple perturbative model based on a sum over indistinguishable quantum paths describes the observed asymmetry as a function of photoelectron energy and CEP. Although the individual multiphoton transition rates depend on the intensity profile of the pulse, the experimentally measured photoelectron angular distributions are sensitive to the absolute spectral phase of the pulse, including both CEP and chirp. We discuss retrieval of the CEP and chirp from the asymmetry pattern, as well as the potential to extract the scattering phase shift.},

Half-cycle cutoff analysis confirms that harmonic generation proceeds in the ionization-gated regime. The attosecond pulse contrast is measured using the technique of carrier-envelope phase (CEP)-scanning, recently developed by our group, in which photoelectrons generated from Ne atoms by the harmonic pulse are streaked as a function of CEP. Streaking of photoelectrons as a function of attosecond time delay also confirms the isolated nature of the harmonic pulse, which is measured to have a duration of 430{$\pm$}15 as, limited by the bandwidth of the reflective X-ray optics employed. The combined measurements imply that the experimental advantages of the ionization gating technique--tunable X-ray emission, relaxed sensitivity to the CEP and scalability to longer driver pulses--are also conferred on isolated attosecond pulse production.},

The measurements are compared with the predictions of an empirical formula derived by Boling, Glass, and Owyoung. This formula, which relates n2 to the linear refractive index and its dispersion, is shown to be accurate to within about 30\% for materials with nonlinear indices ranging over 3 orders of magnitude. Measurements for a number of binary oxide and fluoride crystals have been analyzed under the assumption that the hyperpolarizability of the anion is much larger than that of the cation. It is found that the hyperpolarizability of oxygen varies by a factor of 10, and that of fluorine varies by a factor of 7, depending on the size of the coordinating cation. This behavior is similar to that of the linear polarizability, although the hyperpolarizability is much more sensitive than the linear polarizability to the identity of the cation. The measured halide ion hyperpolarizabilities for several alkali-halide crystals are in reasonable agreement with recent self-consistent calculations. A semiempirical model was proposed by Wilson and Curtis to account for the dependence of the linear anionic polarizability on the radius of the cation. This model also accounts quite well for the variation of the hyperpolarizability of both fluorine and oxygen, except for cation partners that have filled or unfilled d-electron shells. The nonlinear indices of a number of complex oxides (i.e., those with more than one cation) have been calculated from the partial hyperpolarizabilities deduced from the data for the binary oxides. The calculated and measured values of n2 agree to within an average error of 13\%.},

Here we propose a numerical scheme for highly efficient high-order harmonic generation and hence the generation of ultrabroadband IAPs in the XUV and soft-x-ray regions. The scheme combines the use of chirped pulses with trapped electrons in copper transition-metal surfaces and takes advantage of the characteristic features of an infrared (IR) single-cycle pulse to achieve high conversion efficiencies and large spectral bandwidths. In particular, we show that ultrabroad IAPs with a duration of 370 as and with a bandwidth covering the photon energy range of 50\textendash 250 and 350\textendash 450 eV can be produced. We further show that introducing an additional IR single-cycle pulse permits us to enhance the harmonic yield in the soft-x-ray photon energy region by almost seven orders of magnitude. Our findings thus elucidate the relevance of trapped electrons in metal surfaces for developing stable and highly efficient attosecond light sources in compact solid-state devices.},

The power dependence of the photoemission yield does not follow a simple power law dependence corresponding to the number of photons absorbed. This behavior is reminiscent of other above threshold ionization (ATI) or tunnel ionization (TI) processes observed for atoms in the gas phase. The photoelectrons are generated with laser pulsewidths less than 100 fs in duration and peak powers as low as 100 MW/cm2. These intensities are on the order of 105 times lower than that required to observe similar phenomena in the gas phase. The relatively low intensities and correlation with surface roughness suggests a contribution from a surface enhancement mechanism. Thermal heating and space charge effects have been ruled out, and the possibility of electric field enhancement at the surface due to the coupling of photons into surface plasmons is discussed. The nonlinear yield and enhancement of the photoemission produced by short pulse excitation needs to be considered when discussing photoinduced hot electron reaction channels at metal surfaces.},

This interferometer is fabricated from a single-crystal silicon cantilever on a transmission electron microscope grid by gallium focused-ion-beam milling. Using this interferometer, we obtain interference fringes in a Mach-Zehnder geometry in an unmodified 200\,kV transmission electron microscope. The fringes have a period of 0.32\,nm, which corresponds to the [{\=1}{\=1}1] lattice planes of silicon, and a maximum contrast of 15\%. We use convergent-beam electron diffraction to quantify grating alignment and coherence. This design can potentially be scaled to millimeter-scale, and used in electron holography.

  abstract = {Interaction-free measurement (IFM) has been proposed as a means of high-resolution, low-damage imaging of radiation-sensitive samples, such as biomolecules and proteins. The basic setup for IFM is a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, and recent progress in nanofabricated electron diffraction gratings has made it possible to incorporate a Mach-Zehnder interferometer in a transmission-electron microscope (TEM). Therefore, the limits of performance of IFM with such an interferometer and a shot-noise limited electron source (such as that in a TEM) are of interest. In this work, we compared the error probability and sample damage for ideal IFM and classical imaging schemes, through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. We considered a sample that is either completely transparent or completely opaque at each pixel. In our analysis, we also evaluated the impact of an additional detector for scattered electrons. The additional detector resulted in reduction of error by up to an order of magnitude, for both IFM and classical schemes. We also investigated a sample re-illumination scheme based on updating priors after each round of illumination and found that this scheme further reduced error by a factor of two. Implementation of these methods is likely achievable with existing instrumentation and would result in improved resolution in low-dose electron microscopy.},

Much of the interaction of intense light pulses with matter commences with electrons tunneling from atoms or molecules to the continuum. Until recently, this starting point was assumed to be the highest occupied orbital of a given system. We have now observed tunneling from a lower-lying state in hydrogen chloride (HCl). Analyzing two independent experimental observables allowed us to isolate (via fragment ions), identify (via molecular frame photoelectron angular distributions), and, with the help of ab initio simulations, quantify the contribution of lower-lying orbitals to the total and angle-dependent tunneling current of the molecule. Our results bolster the emerging tenet that the coherent interaction between different orbitals--which can amplify the impact of lower orbitals--must be considered in tunneling processes.},

The latter equals the energy difference between the vacuum level and the top of the valance band only for a range of high resistivities where the bands are flat to the surface over the escape depth of emitted electrons (about 25 \AA ). This photoelectric threshold is 5.15{$\pm$}0.08 eV. The work function varies only from 4.9 to 4.7 eV in going from extreme p to extreme n type, being close to 4.83 eV throughout most of the doping range. The flat band or neutral surface condition occurs for high-resistivity ({$\sim$}500 {$\Omega$}cm) p-type bulk doping, for which the Fermi level lies {$\sim$}0.23 eV below the mid-gap. The results indicate a surface-state density approximately equal to the surface atom density of 8\texttimes 1014/cm2 with the states located in two groups, one normally empty just below the center of the gap and another normally filled just above the valence-band edge.},

This wide spectral emission range opens applications in gas sensing and optical interconnects. All these lasers are monolithically grown in the InGaAlAs-InP material system utilizing a buried tunnel junction (BTJ) as current aperture. Fabricated with a novel high-speed design with reduced parasitics, bandwidths in excess of 10 GHz at 1.3 and 1.55 \textmu m have been achieved. Therefore, the coarse wavelength division multiplexing (CWDM) wavelength range of 1.3 to 1.6 \textmu m at 10 Gb/s can be accomplished with one technology. Error-free data-transmission at 10 Gb/s over a fiber link of 20 km is demonstrated. One-dimensional arrays have been fabricated with emission wavelengths addressable by current tuning. Micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) tunable devices provide an extended tuning range in excess of 50 nm with high spectral purity. All these devices feature continuous-wave (CW) operation with typical single-mode output powers exceeding 1 mW. The operation voltage is around 1-1.5 V and power consumption is as low as 10-20 mW. Furthermore, we have also developed VCSELs based on GaSb, targeting at the wavelength range from 2.3 to 3.0 \textmu m. The functionality of tunable diode laser spectroscopy (TDLS) systems is shown by presenting a laser hygrometer applying a 1.84-\textmu m VCSEL.},

Andersen et al. report measurements of electron transport in ultraclean graphene devices where the electron drift velocity is extremely high. They found that direct current at high drift velocities generates a large increase in the noise at gigahertz frequencies and that the noise grows exponentially in the direction of the current. The authors attribute the emission mechanism to amplification of acoustic phonons through the Cerenkov effect. Science, this issue p. 154 Understanding and controlling nonequilibrium electronic phenomena is an outstanding challenge in science and engineering. By electrically driving ultraclean graphene devices out of equilibrium, we observe an instability that is manifested as substantially enhanced current fluctuations and suppressed conductivity at microwave frequencies. Spatial mapping of the nonequilibrium current fluctuations using nanoscale magnetic field sensors reveals that the fluctuations grow exponentially along the direction of carrier flow. Our observations, including the dependence on density and temperature, are consistently explained by the emergence of an electron-phonon Cerenkov instability at supersonic drift velocities. These results offer the opportunity for tunable terahertz generation and active phononic devices based on two-dimensional materials. A dc drive current in graphene is used to generate terahertz acoustic waves. A dc drive current in graphene is used to generate terahertz acoustic waves.},

We probe the few-femtosecond electronic dephasing of a local surface plasmon polariton excitation using symmetry-selective second-harmonic (SH) Rayleigh scattering of a nanoscopic conical gold tip as an individual plasmonic nanostructure. The full reconstruction of the optical response function of the plasmon excitation with phase and amplitude without any model assumptions is demonstrated from the analysis of the two-dimensional spectrogram obtained by simultaneous time- and frequency-domain SH measurements, using interferometric frequency resolved optical gating. The measured dephasing time of T2 = 18 {$\pm$} 5 fs indicates the plasmon damping is dominated by nonradiative decay, consistent with a Drude-Sommerfeld dielectric response for gold. Even for the nominally homogeneous localized plasmon response, deviations are observed from the ideal harmonic oscillator phase behavior, which may reflect the underlying inhomogeneous electronic response with its different scattering channels. The presented technique is generally applicable for the reconstruction of the plasmon dynamics of complex nanostructures: information that cannot be obtained by conventional dark-field scattering.},

The theory describes the electron beam as a moving plasma dielectric, and assumes that the electron beam interacts with an evanescent mode traveling along the surface of a periodic waveguide with a rectangular profile. The phase velocity of the evanescent wave is synchronous with the electron velocity, but the group velocity is actually negative. The electron beam amplifies the evanescent wave, which does not itself radiate. According to this picture, the radiation observed emanating from the grating is Smith-Purcell radiation enhanced by the bunching of the electrons due to the interaction with the evanescent mode. There will also be radiation from the part of the evanescent mode that is outcoupled from the ends of the grating. This radiation appears at a lower frequency than the Smith-Purcell radiation. The new results explain both the gain and the radiation observed in the experiments of Urata and Walsh, and the cube-root current dependence of the gain inferred by Bakhtyari, Walsh, and Brownell.},

The enhancement of the spectral intensity is accompanied by large changes in the angular and spectral distribution of the radiation when the electrons appear in periodic bunches. This is called superradiance. Recently, superradiant SP radiation has been observed from a so-called Smith-Purcell free-electron laser (SP-FEL) in which the electrons are bunched by the lasing process. As in other slow-wave structures, the electron beam in a SP-FEL interacts with an evanescent wave for which the phase velocity matches the electron velocity and amplifies it. The frequency of this wave lies below the range of SP radiation and the wave is not radiated except from the ends of the grating. However, the bunching of the electrons by the interaction with the evanescent wave enhances the ordinary Smith-Purcell radiation and changes the angular and spectral distribution due to superradiant effects. In this article, we introduce a new method for computing the SP radiation in three dimensions, including the effects of finite grating length and superradiance due to periodic electron bunching at an arbitrary frequency. We show that the SP radiation develops spectrally and angularly narrow peaks at the harmonics of the bunching frequency. In rf linacs, where the bunches are widely spaced, several closely spaced harmonics lie under the spectral envelope of the emission from a single electron. In a SP-FEL the harmonics are widely spaced and the SP radiation appears in narrow cones at the SP angles corresponding to the harmonics of the bunching frequency. Finally, we calculate the angular spectral fluence radiated by an electron passing over a lamellar grating of finite length, examine its coherent enhancement in SP-FELs and rf linacs, and compare the results with numerical simulations and available experimental data.},

We have achieved 1.6\texttimes 1011 A/m2 by photofield emission from a new type of photocathode made from a metallic-composite, multifilamentary Nb3Sn wire driven by a 266 nm picosecond laser pulse and a 2 ns, 50 kV accelerating voltage. This cathode has a micrometer arrayed structure with tens of thousands of Nb/Nb3Sn filaments embedded in a bronze matrix. Our measurements revealed the existence of a new electron emission regime at high laser fluence (100 mJ/cm2). We have extracted stably, and without any surface ablation, up to 4800 pC of charge. This corresponds to 0.9\% quantum efficiency, 100 times larger than what is measured from conventional metallic photocathodes. The unexpected large and stable charge extraction cannot be explained by the 3-step model. Thanks to the small emitting area, the measured emittance (0.6 mm{$\cdot$}mrad) is low in spite of the high current density and space charge effects. This cathode will be of benefit for many applications based on short and bright electron bunches.},

Due to low ionization energy and wide potential well, they exhibit distinctively high HHG efficiency and high cutoff energy for out-of-plane pumping, although they also show atomic-like behavior. For out-of-plane pumping with a peak intensity of 40 TW cm-2 at 1550 nm, high harmonics up to 120th order are generated with efficiency 4 orders-of-magnitude higher than monolayer h-BN. For pump intensity below the direct above-threshold ionization (ATI) regime, the tunneling from the ground state and ATI from one- or two-photon resonant state simultaneously contribute to HHG. In the other subnitride monolayers of alkaline earth with larger atomic sizes (Ca2N and Sr2N), further higher harmonic generation efficiencies are obtained due to the lower work functions and wider potential wells. For in-plane pumping, the intraband transition is the major source of the HHG due to the metallic in-plane responses. The presented results will attract great attention due to the peculiar HHG signature from fundamental aspects and pave the way of obtaining coherent extreme ultraviolet (EUV)/soft-X-ray with high efficiency by using monolayer electrides.},

After a study of the initial boundary-value problem in a bounded domain with a transparent boundary condition, some unconditionally stable discretization schemes are developed for this kind of problem. The main difficulty is linked to the involvement of a fractional integral operator defining the transparent operator. The proposed semi-discretization of this operator yields with a very different point of view the one proposed by Yevick, Friese and Schmidt [J. Comput. Phys. 168 (2001) 433]. Two possible choices of transparent boundary conditions based on the Dirichlet\textendash Neumann (DN) and Neumann\textendash Dirichlet (ND) operators are presented. To preserve the stability of the fully discrete scheme, conform Galerkin finite element methods are employed for the spatial discretization. Finally, some numerical tests are performed to study the respective accuracy of the different schemes.},

@article{ArticleULTRASHORTPULSE,
  title = {Article: {{ULTRASHORT PULSE PROPAGATION THROUGH DEPRESSED-CLADDING CHANNEL WAVEGUIDES IN YAG CRYSTAL}}: {{SPATIO-TEMPORAL CHARACTERIZATION}}},
  note = {\textbf{Review}
\par
In this work "Ultrafast Pulse Propagation Through Depressed-Cladding Channel Waveguides in YAG Crystal: Saptiotemporal Characterization", the authors present a spatiotemporal characterization of femtosecond pulses traveling through depressed-cladding channel waveguides.~ As the authors indicate, while such waveguides have been investigated extensively, their use in ultrafast applications is currently sparse.~ This investigation demonstrates that no detrimental effects are observed in the spatiotemporal properties of pulses after traveling through the waveguides.~
\par
To my understanding, the work is new and the data seems carefully taken.~ However, before publications the authors should carefully address my major comments listed below.~
\par
Major Comments:
\par
1. In the second paragraph on page 2, I note that the authors state that the use of such ULI waveguides in ultrafast applications is "almost unexplored".~ However, it is not unexplored.~ They do cite ref. 10, but I was able to find other references (e.g. Appl. Phys. Lett. \textbf{97}, 111114 (2010); \href{https://doi-org.libproxy.mit.edu/10.1063/1.3486177}{https://doi-org.libproxy.mit.edu/10.1063/1.3486177}) where such waveguides were used in femtosecond systems.~ Such references should be cited here.
\par
2. Along with comment (1) above, I felt that in the second paragraph on page 2 the authors are setting up the motivation for this work.~ However, I felt this was one of the weakest portions of this paper.~ The authors should improve this section with further examples/references to demonstrate why ULI for ultrafast applications would indeed be so useful?~ Why would it be preferred over other technologies?~ I felt myself not being completely convinced of why I need to use such waveguides in ultrafast applications, and this is a must to motivate this work.~
\par
3. In fig. 3a, it seems that the spectral shape changes when going through the ULI waveguide as opposed to just the YAG.~ You never comment on this, but it could also change the output pulse temporal properties.~ Is the pulse duration shown in the right panel assuming the input spectrum with phase given by that measured from 3a?~ In other words, assuming you have a perfectly compressed pulse, you considered the output pulse duration if the pulse were to only travel through the YAG or YAG ULI waveguide?~ Was the spectral amplitude shape change also included?~ I think the authors need to comment on the amplitude changes as they are also important to ultrafast applications.~
\par
4. You seem to have performed a rather accurate measure of GDD after traveling through the YAG with your method, giving confidence in your results.~ However, you do not specify the GDD you measure through the ULI.~ Is it measurably different than the plain YAG?~ The authors should comment on the numerical value of the GDD through the ULI waveguide and if it has any difference to the YAG to within the uncertainty of the measurement as this was the point of this work.~
\par
5. In the first paragraph of 3.2, the authors state the spatial resolution of 4 um.~ However, I assume this is in the plane of the fiber being translated.~ What is the resolution in the plane of the ULI waveguide/YAG output?~ What is the magnification factor?~ This is not specified directly as far as I can tell and is confusing as later you discuss features in the distance relative to the output of the ULI waveguide/YAG and it is not clear if you are speaking about dimensions at the translated fiber or at the ULI waveguide/YAG output.~
\par
6. In the conclusion section, you say you adapted STARFISH.~ I would say you "used" it as there really was not any significant adaption over the original work.
\par
7. In the conclusion section, and in the manuscript, you discuss the spatiotemporal differences between the monomodal and multimodal waveguide structures.~ What is not clear is whether any of the results are due to the ULI technique, or simply due to expected effects from such waveguide geometries.~ The authors should comment on whether this finding is just simply expected due to the waveguide geometries or is in any way due to the ULI process (I suspect the former, but it should be stated clearly).~
\par
Minor Comments
\par
1. I have attached a marked up pdf.~ The strike-outs and highlights have text comments included with them.~ There are also several notes with questions and suggestions for improvement of the manuscript.~},

We met both requirements by separating the processes into two steps by first forming a monolayer of gold nanoparticles on a suitable liquid subphase of anisole and then transferring it edgewise onto a silicon substrate with a prepatterned template comprising nanoposts and nanogratings. Doing so resulted in nanoparticles that assembled in commensuration with the template design while exhibiting appreciable template-induced strain. These dense arrays of nanostructures could either be directly applied or used as lithographic masks in applications for light collection, chemical sensing, and data storage.},

The ionized electron wavefunction carries information on the structure of the bound orbital, the ionic potential as well as the photo-ionization dynamics itself. While photoelectron spectroscopy resolves the absolute amplitude of the wavefunction, retrieving the spectral phase information has been a long-standing challenge. Here, we transfer the electron phase retrieval problem into an optical one by measuring the time-reversed process of photo-ionization -- photo-recombination -- in attosecond pulse generation. We demonstrate all-optical interferometry of two independent phase-locked attosecond light sources. This measurement enables us to directly determine the phase shift associated with electron scattering in simple quantum systems such as helium and neon, over a large energy range. In addition, the strong-field nature of attosecond pulse generation resolves the dipole phase around the Cooper minimum in argon through a single scattering angle, along with phase signatures of multi-electron effects. Our study bears the prospect of probing complex orbital phases in molecular systems as well as electron correlations through resonances subject to strong laser fields.},

  abstract = {The hot debate regarding attosecond dynamics of optical tunneling has, so far, been focused on the presence, or absence, of time delays associated to the electron tunnelling through the classically forbidden region during atomic ionization in intense infrared laser fields. Strong theoretical and experimental arguments have been put forward to advocate the polar opposite points of view. The underlying dynamics are richer. Here we propose to use the nonlinear optical responses of the tunnelling electrons to tailored light fields to track these dynamics in full complexity. Using the combination of single-color and two-color fields, we resolve not only ionization delays, but also temporal re-shaping and spatial re-focusing of the tunnelling wavepacket as it emerges from the classically forbidden region. Access to these details of the dynamics is facilitated by the near-instantaneous nature of the nonlinear optical response driven by ionization, and by using tailored laser pulses to induce this response. Our work introduces a new type of attoclock for optical tunnelling, one that is based on measuring light rather than photo-electrons. Our conclusions suggest a possible middle ground between the two conflicting points of view.},

By placing a movable mask in front of a double-slit to control the transmission through the individual slits, probability distributions for single- and double-slit arrangements were observed. Also, by recording single electron detection events diffracting through a double-slit, a diffraction pattern was built up from individual events.},

The measurements are made at 130 kV in the ultraviolet and visible range with gratings of 1221.2 lines/mm. For this purpose, we recall the theoretical formulas for the power and the line breadth as a function of the incidence angle of the electrons on the grating: These two quantities characterize the emission mechanism. We then show briefly how various experimental parameters can affect the results. We thus deduce that the observed radiation does indeed arise from the process initially proposed (i.e., diffraction of the electron field). The line breadth agrees well with the theory. With the assumption that the average groove profile is close to that claimed by the manufacturer (in fact the grooves appear irregular in electron-microscope measurements) the theory accounts for the main features of the observed dependence of the power and radiation patterns upon the wavelength and the metal. Numerical calculations of the influence of the profile show that within the experimental error the theory satisfactorily predicts the absolute emitted power. A rise in intensity is measured at the surface plasma wavelength for Ag; this is in agreement with the theory.},

However, the on-chip integration\textemdash a task highly relevant for future nanotechnological devices\textemdash necessitates the reduction of the spatial footprint of sensing schemes by the deployment of novel concepts. A promising route towards this goal is predicated on the controllable directional emission of the fundamentally smallest emitters of light, i.e., dipoles, as an indicator. Here we realize an integrated displacement sensor based on the directional emission of Huygens dipoles excited in an individual dipolar antenna. The position of the antenna relative to the excitation field determines its directional coupling into a six-way crossing of photonic crystal waveguides. In our experimental study supported by theoretical calculations, we demonstrate the first prototype of an integrated displacement sensor with a standard deviation of the position accuracy below {$\lambda$}/300 at room temperature and ambient conditions.},

  abstract = {EUV lithography (EUVL) is the leading technology, beyond 193-nm-based optical lithography, for printing circuits at the 32-nm node and below in a high volume manufacturing (HVM) environment fab. In EUVL, a 13.5-nm radiation wavelength generated by an EUV source is used to print circuits. Because light is strongly absorbed at this wavelength, the entire EUVL scanner system must be in a vacuum environment, and all optics must be reflective instead of refractive. Based on the HVM requirements of 100 wafers per hour (WPH) throughput and other system requirements for optics, resist sensitivity, and overhead (see Sec. 3.2.3), a power requirement of 115 to 180 W, based on resist sensitivity, has been specified for HVM EUVL scanners. Besides power, EUV sources must meet additional specifications (Sec. 3.2.2). The production-level requirements for EUV sources (Table 3.1) have been jointly agreed upon by major EUVL scanner manufacturers. Table 3.2 shows the change in EUV source requirements over time. Discharge-produced plasma (DPP) and laser-produced plasma (LPP) are the leading technologies for generating high-power EUV radiation at 13.5 nm. In both technologies, hot plasma of \textasciitilde 30 eV of the chosen fuel material is generated, which produces EUV radiation. In DPP, magnetic pinching of low-temperature plasma generates the high-temperature plasma. In LPP, the target material is heated by a laser pulse to generate the high-temperature plasma. Today, tin (Sn) is the leading fuel for HVM-level EUV sources, with xenon (Xe) still being used to meet the lower power requirements of metrology sources, microexposure tools (METs), and alpha-level scanners.},

Graphene offers unique opportunities for studying 1/f noise because of its two-dimensional structure and widely tunable two-dimensional carrier concentration. The creation of practical graphene-based devices will also depend on our ability to understand and control the low-frequency noise in this material system.

  abstract = {Relativistic charged particles forced to move along curved trajectories by applied magnetic fields emit electromagnetic radiation called Synchrotron Radiation; today electron storage rings are routinely used to provide synchrotron radiation to users in a wide spectral range from infrared to hard X-rays. Thanks to its peculiar characteristics, synchrotron radiation is one of the more powerful tools for investi- gating the properties of matter in many different fields like molecular and atomic physics, cell biology, medical applications, nanotechnology, catalysis and cultural heritage. Up to now three generations of synchrotron radiation sources emitting radi- ation with increasing quality have been developed; the fourth generation, based on free-electron lasers, already produces high power and ultrafast pulses of highly coher- ent radiation. In the present contribution, the main characteristics and properties of the synchrotron radiation sources and of the produced radiation are introduced and explained using a simple approach.},

  abstract = {The amplitude and frequency of laser light can be routinely measured and controlled on a femtosecond (10-15 s) timescale1. However, in pulses comprising just a few wave cycles, the amplitude envelope and carrier frequency are not sufficient to characterize and control laser radiation, because evolution of the light field is also influenced by a shift of the carrier wave with respect to the pulse peak2. This so-called carrier-envelope phase has been predicted3,4,5,6,7,8,9 and observed10 to affect strong-field phenomena, but random shot-to-shot shifts have prevented the reproducible guiding of atomic processes using the electric field of light. Here we report the generation of intense, few-cycle laser pulses with a stable carrier envelope phase that permit the triggering and steering of microscopic motion with an ultimate precision limited only by quantum mechanical uncertainty. Using these reproducible light waveforms, we create light-induced atomic currents in ionized matter; the motion of the electronic wave packets can be controlled on timescales shorter than 250 attoseconds (250 \texttimes{} 10-18 s). This enables us to control the attosecond temporal structure of coherent soft X-ray emission produced by the atomic currents\textemdash these X-ray photons provide a sensitive and intuitive tool for determining the carrier-envelope phase.},

We show experimentally and numerically that the addition of a second laser field, and later a third, at a noncommensurate frequency relative to the driving field can modify the subcycle shape of the electric field, leading to the appearance of additional spectral components between the usual odd harmonics and in some cases a quasicontinuum. We perform a parametric study of the frequency ratio between the two first laser fields, the result of which is in good agreement with theoretical selection rules. We also show numerically that using three laser frequencies from an optical parametric amplifier can achieve a single attosecond pulse from a 24-fs laser pulse.},

A condition of no net charge on the surface atoms may correspond to a partial filling of these states. If the density of surface levels is sufficiently high, there will be an appreciable double layer at the free surface of a semi-conductor formed from a net charge from electrons in surface states and a space charge of opposite sign, similar to that at a rectifying junction, extending into the semi-conductor. This double layer tends to make the work function independent of the height of the Fermi level in the interior (which in turn depends on impurity content). If contact is made with a metal, the difference in work function between metal and semi-conductor is compensated by surface states charge, rather than by a space charge as is ordinarily assumed, so that the space charge layer is independent of the metal. Rectification characteristics are then independent of the metal. These ideas are used to explain results of Meyerhof and others on the relation between contact potential differences and rectification.},

In practice, this limited spectral resolution together with the need for multiple excitation wavelengths to excite different fluorophores limits multiphoton microscopy to imaging a few, spectrally distinct fluorescent labels at a time, restricting the complexity of biological processes that can be studied. Here, we demonstrate a hyperspectral multiphoton microscope that utilizes three different wavelength excitation sources together with multiplexed fluorescence emission detection using angle-tuned bandpass filters. This microscope maintains scattering insensitivity, while providing high enough spectral resolution on the emitted fluorescence and capitalizing on the wavelength-dependent nonlinear excitation of fluorescent dyes to enable clean separation of multiple, spectrally overlapping labels, in vivo. We demonstrated the utility of this instrument for spectral separation of closely overlapped fluorophores in samples containing 10 different colors of fluorescent beads, live cells expressing up to seven different fluorescent protein fusion constructs, and in multiple in vivo preparations in mouse cortex and inflamed skin, with up to eight different cell types or tissue structures distinguished.},

However, this chiral transport prevents the simple use of electrostatic gates to define electron-optical devices in graphene.

The ability to capture selected-area-image dynamics with pixel resolution and to control the time separation between pulses for temporal cooling of the specimen made possible studies of fleeting structures and morphologies. We demonstrate the potential for applications with two examples, gold and graphite. For gold, after thermally induced stress, we determined the atomic structural expansion, the nonthermal lattice temperature, and the ultrafast transients of warping/bulging. In contrast, in graphite, striking coherent transients of the structure were observed in both image and diffraction, directly measuring, on the nanoscale, the longitudinal resonance period governed by Young's elastic modulus. The success of these studies demonstrates the promise of UEM in real-space imaging of dynamics. Imaging with single electrons can track structural dynamics of gold and graphite in real space with femtosecond temporal resolution and angstrom spatial resolution.

Given the nature of interactions between electrons and photons, and considering their connections through nanostructures, it should be possible to achieve imaging of evanescent electromagnetic fields with electron pulses when such fields are resolved in both space (nanometre and below) and time (femtosecond). Here we report the development of photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM), and the associated phenomena. We show that the precise spatiotemporal overlap of femtosecond single-electron packets with intense optical pulses at a nanostructure (individual carbon nanotube or silver nanowire in this instance) results in the direct absorption of integer multiples of photon quanta (n{$\hslash\omega$}) by the relativistic electrons accelerated to 200 keV. By energy-filtering only those electrons resulting from this absorption, it is possible to image directly in space the near-field electric field distribution, obtain the temporal behaviour of the field on the femtosecond timescale, and map its spatial polarization dependence. We believe that the observation of the photon-induced near-field effect in ultrafast electron microscopy demonstrates the potential for many applications, including those of direct space-time imaging of localized fields at interfaces and visualization of phenomena related to photonics, plasmonics and nanostructures.},

  abstract = {Conventional ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) has been successfully used for decades to study static electronic properties of surfaces and their interaction with adsorbates. The recent progress in the creation of femtosecond and attosecond VUV pulses by means of high-order harmonic generation (HHG) opens the potential to operate UPS in a time-resolved mode, which is capable of monitoring ultra-fast dynamical changes of surface properties. It is now possible to evaluate the temporal evolution of chemical surface reactions on their fundamental time scales. This paper reviews technical aspects of time-resolved UPS and its application to the study of ultra-fast surface processes. Special emphasis is placed on the creation of ultra-short VUV pulses by means of HHG and also on the description of the stroboscopic experimental approach that enables temporal resolutions of the order of femtoseconds. This review will show that time-resolved UPS is indeed capable of probing with femtosecond resolution dynamic surface processes related, for example, to electronic excitations at surfaces or to the chemical state of adsorbates on a femtosecond time scale.},

For harmonic photon energies smaller than the band gap, the harmonic yield is found to differ by up to 14 orders of magnitude for the two topological phases. This giant topological effect is explained by the degree of destructive interference in the harmonic emission of all valence-band (and edge-state) electrons, which strongly depends on whether or not topological edge states are present. The combination of strong-field laser physics with topological condensed matter opens up new possibilities to electronically control strong-field-based light or particle sources or\textemdash conversely\textemdash to steer by all optical means topological electronics.},

  abstract = {Ultrafast electron microscopy and diffraction are powerful techniques for the study of the time-resolved structures of molecules, materials, and biological systems. Central to these approaches is the use of ultrafast coherent electron packets. The electron pulses typically have an energy of 30 keV for diffraction and 100\textendash 200 keV for microscopy, corresponding to speeds of 33\textendash 70\% of the speed of light. Although the spatial resolution can reach the atomic scale, the temporal resolution is limited by the pulse width and by the difference in group velocities of electrons and the light used to initiate the dynamical change. In this contribution, we introduce the concept of tilted optical pulses into diffraction and imaging techniques and demonstrate the methodology experimentally. These advances allow us to reach limits of time resolution down to regimes of a few femtoseconds and, possibly, attoseconds. With tilted pulses, every part of the sample is excited at precisely the same time as when the electrons arrive at the specimen. Here, this approach is demonstrated for the most unfavorable case of ultrafast crystallography. We also present a method for measuring the duration of electron packets by autocorrelating electron pulses in free space and without streaking, and we discuss the potential of tilting the electron pulses themselves for applications in domains involving nuclear and electron motions. ultrafast imaging femtosecond electron pulses electron autocorrelation},

  abstract = {Lynx requires large-format x-ray imaging detectors with performance at least as good as the best current-generation devices but with much higher readout rates. We are investigating an advanced charge-coupled device (CCD) detector architecture under development at MIT Lincoln Laboratory for use in the Lynx high-definition x-ray imager and x-ray grating spectrometer instruments. This architecture features a CMOS-compatible detector integrated with parallel CMOS signal processing chains. Fast, low-noise amplifiers and highly parallel signal processing provide the high frame rates required. CMOS-compatibility of the CCD enables low-power charge transfer and signal processing. We report on the performance of CMOS-compatible test CCDs read at pixel rates up to 5.0 Mpix s - 1 (50 times faster than Chandra ACIS CCDs), with transfer clock swings as low as 1.0-V peak-to-peak (power/gate-area comparable to ACIS CCDs at 100 times the parallel transfer rate). We measure read noise of 4.6 electrons RMS at 2.5 MHz and x-ray spectral resolution better than 150-eV full-width at half maximum at 5.9 keV for single-pixel events. We report charge transfer efficiency measurements and demonstrate that buried channel trough implants as narrow as 0.8 {$\mu$}m are effective in improving charge transfer performance. We find that the charge transfer efficiency of these devices drops significantly as detector temperature is reduced from {$\sim$} - 30 \textdegree{} C to -60 \textdegree{} C. We point out the potential of previously demonstrated curved-detector fabrication technology for simplifying the design of the Lynx high-definition imager. We discuss the expected detector radiation tolerance at these relatively high transfer rates. Finally, we note that the high pixel ``aspect ratio'' (depletion depth: pixel size {$\approx$}9 {$:$} 1) of our test devices is similar to that expected for Lynx detectors and discuss implications of this geometry for x-ray performance and noise requirements.},

The parametric effect is achieved by modulating magnetic flux through the SQUID at a frequency close to the sum of two resonator-mode frequencies. For modulation amplitudes exceeding an instability threshold, self-sustained oscillations are observed in both modes. The amplitudes of these oscillations show good quantitative agreement with a theoretical model. The oscillation phases are found to be correlated and exhibit strong fluctuations which broaden the oscillation spectral linewidths. These linewidths are significantly reduced by applying a weak on-resonant tone, which also suppresses the phase fluctuations. When the weak tone is detuned, we observe synchronization of the oscillation frequency with the frequency of the input. For the detuned input, we also observe an emergence of three idlers in the output. This observation is in agreement with theory indicating four-mode amplification and squeezing of a coherent input.},

Scattered throughout the work are a number of lucid remarks on the character of Islamic mathematics or of mathematical work in general. The book will hence not only be an excellent textbook for the teaching of the history of mathematics but also for the liberal art aspect of mathematics teaching in general. - Jens H\o yrup, Mathematical Reviews ...as a textbook, this work is highly commendable...It is definitely the product of a skillful mathematician who has collected over the years a reasonably large number of interesting problems from medieval Arabic mathematics. None of them is pursued to exhaustion, but all of them arranged in such a way, together with accompanying exercises, so that they would engage an active mind and introduce a subject, which I am sure the author agrees with me is, at this stage, very difficult to introduce. - G.Saliba, Zentralblatt},

  abstract = {This review focuses on the generation of energetic (hot) electrons in plasmonic metastructures and nanomaterials, and their characterization through time-resolved spectroscopy. Excitation of hot electrons under illumination occurs in any metal or conductor, but their number will vary for each type of nanostructure. While plasmonic resonances are well described classically, the excitation of hot electrons (HEs) is a quantum process and its description requires further elaboration. Some potential applications for HEs lie in the fields of photo-catalysis and optoelectronics, and their study constitutes a very active interdisciplinary research direction that involves chemistry, physics and device engineering. Here we focus on some particular developments enabling the use of hot carriers for these applications. Particularly, we discuss the approaches and structures required to create hot carriers, the temporal dynamics of hot carrier formation and relaxation, and relevant theoretical methods used to compute the HE dynamics. The observations presented here support the conclusion that the shape of the nanostructure matters. Although metastructures with infrared gap plasmons can exhibit spatially extended hot spots and anomalously large numbers of non-thermalized HEs, most excited carriers in a plasmonic nanostructure typically have small excitation energies. Here we discuss ways to strongly increase the number of high-energy electrons, highlighting the role of hot spots, system size, geometry and resonant frequencies. To generate HEs efficiently, we can take advantage of special geometries with hot spots, such as metamaterial absorbers with ultra-narrow gaps or nanostars. Furthermore, we discuss the applications in ultrafast electronics based on plasmon-enhanced photoemission and tunneling in the nonlinear regime. Considering the longer timescale phenomena, we also present studies on the coherent dynamics in a nanostructure after electron thermalization, showing acoustic breathing modes. In this paper, we review some key developments in the field of ultra-fast plasmonic dynamics and provide a perspective for its possible next steps.},

  title = {Modeling Generation and Characterization of Attosecond Pulses},
  author = {Bhardwaj, Siddharth},
  year = {2014},
  abstract = {Generation of high-order harmonics has emerged as a powerful technique for the generation of broadband coherent radiation in the EUV regime. This has lead to the development of table-top EUV sources that can produce attosecond pulses. These pulses can serve as a probe to resolve atomic attosecond dynamics and image atomic orbitals and molecular motion. Due to high spatial and temporal coherence, high-order harmonic radiation can also be used to seed free electron lasers, which allow the generation of high-intensity X-ray radiation that can be used for imaging biomolecules. Since the first observation of high-order harmonics, effort has been made to accurately model both the generation and the characterization of attosecond pulses. Work on the modeling of high harmonic generation can be divided into two parts: (a) description of the interaction between the JR pulse and atoms that leads to emission of attosecond pulses (the single atom response) and (b) modeling of the propagation of attosecond pulses by accounting for macroscopic phase matching effects. In this work, we will focus on the single atom response which can be calculated either by numerically solving the time dependent Schrodinger equation (TDSE) or through the semi-classical three step model (TSM). In Chapter 2, the theory of light-atom interaction will be reviewed with the focus on the calculation of the dipole trasition matrix element (DTME) in the strong field formalism. It will be shown that the choice of the basis states - Volkov states and Coulomb Volkov states - to describe electrons in the continuum is crucial to the accuracy of DTME calculation. In Chapter 3, the TSM will be derived from the Schrodinger equation by using the saddle point approximation. Through this derivation, the quantum mechanical laser-atom interaction is reduced to a semi-classical model comprising of ionization, propagation and recombination . The numerical scheme for solving the TDSE will be discussed. It will then be used to demonstrate the generation of isolated attosecond pulses from non-sinusoidal sub-cycle pulses. The results of ADK and non-adiabatic ionization models will be compared with that from numerical TDSE, and then used to calculate the harmonic spectra in the tunneling and multi-photon ionization regimes. The recombination step of the TSM, which plays a crucial role in determining the qualitative shape of the high-order harmonic spectrum, will be investigated in Chapter 4. A commonly observed feature of Argon's high-order harmonic spectrum is the presence of a minimum at around 50 eV called the Cooper minimum. The minimum in the high-order harmonic spectrum has been attributed to the minimum in the recombination amplitude. The recombination amplitude will be calculated - in the strong field formalism - using length and acceleration form for two choices of continuum electron wavefunction description (Volkov and Coulomb-Volkov). Attosecond pulse characterization techniques, which are an extension of the subpicosecond pulse characterization technique like FROG and SPIDER, rely on the photoionization process to transfer the amplitude and phase information of the attosecond pulse to the photoelectron spectrum. For accurate pulse characterization, it is crucial to model the photoionization process accurately. Since photoionization and recombination are reverse processes, the improvements in the calculation of the recombination amplitude in Chapter 4, can be used to improve the model function of the pulse retrieval algorithm. It will be shown that the proposed improvements are crucial for accurate characterization of low energy EUV pulses.},

  abstract = {Transition of an electron from a free to a bound state is critical in determining the qualitative shape of the spectrum in high-order-harmonic generation (HHG), and in tomographic imaging of orbitals. We calculate and compare the recombination amplitude, from a continuum state described by a plane wave and an outgoing scattering eigenstate, to the bound state for the noble gases that are commonly used in HHG. These calculations are based on the single active electron model and the Hartree-Fock-Slater method, using both the length form and the acceleration form of the dipole matrix element. We confirm that the recombination amplitude versus emitted photon energy strongly depends upon the wave function used to describe the free electron. Depending on the choice of the wave function and the dipole form, the square of the absolute value of the recombination amplitude can differ by almost two orders of magnitude near the experimentally measured Cooper minima. Moreover, only the outgoing scattering eigenstates with the length form roughly predict the experimentally observed Cooper minimum for Ar ({$\sim$}50eV) and Kr ({$\sim$}85eV). We provide a detailed derivation of the photorecombination cross sections from photoionization cross sections (PICSs) calculated by the relativistic random phase approximation (RRPA). For Ar, Kr, and Xe, we compare the total PICSs calculated using our recombination amplitudes with that obtained from RRPA. We find that PICS calculated using the outgoing scattering eigenstates with the length form is in better agreement with the RRPA calculations than the acceleration form.},

The phase matrix elements of a RBC model computed with the II-TM are compared with their counterparts computed with the discrete-dipole approximation (DDA) method. As expected, the DDA results approach the II-TM results with an increase in the number of dipoles per incident wavelength. Computationally, the II-TM is faster than the DDA when multiple RBC orientations are considered. For a single orientation, the DDA is comparable with or even faster than the II-TM because the DDA efficiently converges for optically soft particles; however, the DDA method demands significantly more computer memory than the II-TM. After the applicability of the II-TM is numerically confirmed, a comparison is conducted of the optical properties of oxygenated and deoxygenated RBCs and of normal and deformed RBCs. The spectral variations of RBCs' optical properties are investigated in the wavelength range from 0.25 to 1.0 {$\mu$}m. Furthermore, the statistically averaged phase matrix of spheres and biconcave RBCs are compared. Conducted numerical simulations suggest the applicability of the II-TM for the inverse light scattering analysis and radiative transfer simulations in blood.},

  abstract = {Time-domain sampling of arbitrary electric fields with sub-cycle resolution enables a complete time-frequency analysis of a system's response to electromagnetic illumination. This provides access to dynamic information that is not provided by absorption spectra alone, and has recently been shown through measurements in the infrared that time-domain optical-field sampling offers significant improvements with regard to molecular sensitivity and limits of detection compared to traditional spectroscopic methods. Despite the many scientific and technological motivations, time-domain, optical-field sampling systems operating in the visible to near-infrared spectral regions are seldom accessible, requiring large driving pulse energies, and large laser amplifier systems, bulky apparatuses, and vacuum environments. Here, we demonstrate an all-on-chip, optoelectronic device capable of sampling arbitrary, low-energy, near-infrared waveforms under ambient conditions. Our solid-state integrated detector uses optical-field-driven electron emission from resonant nanoantennas to achieve petahertz-level switching speeds by generating on-chip attosecond electron bursts. These bursts are used to probe the electric field of weak optical transients. We demonstrated our devices by sampling the electric field of a \textasciitilde 5 fJ, broadband near-infrared ultrafast laser pulse using a \textasciitilde 50 pJ near-infrared driving pulse. Our sampling measurements recovered the weak optical transient as well as localized plasmonic dynamics of the emitting nanoantennas \$in\textasciitilde situ\$. This field-sampling device--with its compact footprint and low pulse-energy requirements--offers opportunities in a variety of applications, including: broadband time-domain spectroscopy in the molecular fingerprint region, time-domain analysis of nonlinear phenomena, and detailed studies of strong-field light-matter interactions.},

  month = jun,
  abstract = {We begin by presenting a method to efficiently solve for the steady-state solution of a nonlinear cavity, suitable for simulating a solid-state femtosecond laser. The algorithm directly solves the periodic boundary value problem by using a preconditioned Krylov- Newton shooting solver. The method can be applied to the design and study of mode- locked lasers, as well as the modeling of field enhancement cavities, such as those used in high harmonic generation. In constrast to the standard approach of dynamic sim- ulation, which converges linearly, our algorithm converges quadratically to the stable solution, typically converging two to three orders of magnitude faster than the standard approach. The second major theme is the control of dispersion in mode-locked lasers. The pre- dominant way to design dispersion compensating optics in the past has been a consid- eration of the integrated net group delay dispersion (GDD). We propose and implement an alternative spectral quantity based on the energy contained in phase distortions, which we term the Phase Distortion Ratio (PDR). Dispersion compensating mirrors opti- mized with respect to PDR generally perform significantly better than those where GDD is optimized. We demonstrate this in the design of a dispersion compensating mirror pair capable of compressing single-single pulses. In the final section, we deal with the unique challenges inherent to measuring sub- two-cycle pulses reliably and accurately. We have recently developed a technique, Two- Dimensional spectral Shearing Interferometry (2DSI), based on spectral shearing, which requires no calibration and does not disperse the pulse being measured. Our method in- tuitively encodes spectral group delay in a slowly changing fringe in a two-dimensional interferogram. This maximizes use of spectrometer resolution, allowing for complex phase spectra to be measured with high accuracy over extremely large bandwidths, po- tentially exceeding an octave. We believe that 2DSI is a uniquely cost effective and ef- ficient method for accurately and reliably measuring few- and even single-cycle pulses. While the method is relatively recent, it is well tested and has been successfully demon- strated on several different lasers in two different groups, including one producing 4.9 fs pulses.},

In this work, the self-assembly of a thin film of a spherical-morphology block copolymer is templated using an array of nanoscale topographical elements that act as surrogates for the minority domains of the block copolymer. The orientation and periodicity of the resulting array of spherical microdomains are governed by the commensurability between the block copolymer period and the template period and is accurately described by a free-energy model. This method, which forms high-spatial-frequency arrays using a lower-spatial-frequency template, will be useful in nanolithography applications such as the formation of high-density microelectronic structures. A substrate patterned with a sparse array of nanoscale posts can direct the self-assembly of block copolymers to create a finely ordered lithographic array, even over a large area.

The reaction sequence is widely assumed to involve the intermediacy of a HOCO adduct that has eluded direct monitoring under thermal conditions. Bjork et al. successfully observed the formation of the deuterated analog of this intermediate, DOCO, while simultaneously monitoring OD by using a multifrequency infrared comb. The results confirm the termolecular nature of the formation mechanism and its sensitivity to the ambient bath gas. Science, this issue p. 444 The kinetics of the hydroxyl radical (OH) + carbon monoxide (CO) reaction, which is fundamental to both atmospheric and combustion chemistry, are complex because of the formation of the hydrocarboxyl radical (HOCO) intermediate. Despite extensive studies of this reaction, HOCO has not been observed under thermal reaction conditions. Exploiting the sensitive, broadband, and high-resolution capabilities of time-resolved cavity-enhanced direct frequency comb spectroscopy, we observed deuteroxyl radical (OD) + CO reaction kinetics and detected stabilized trans-DOCO, the deuterated analog of trans-HOCO. By simultaneously measuring the time-dependent concentrations of the trans-DOCO and OD species, we observed unambiguous low-pressure termolecular dependence of the reaction rate coefficients for N2 and CO bath gases. These results confirm the HOCO formation mechanism and quantify its yield.

  abstract = {A Bloch wave (also called Bloch state or Bloch function or Bloch wave function), named after Swiss physicist Felix Bloch, is a type of wavefunction for a particle in a periodically-repeating environment, most commonly an electron in a crystal. A wavefunction {$\psi$} is a Bloch wave if it has the form:                        {$\psi$}         (                    r                  )         =                                 e                                                  i                                         k                          {$\cdot$}                            r                                          u         (                    r                  )                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle \textbackslash psi (\textbackslash mathbf \{r\} )=\textbackslash mathrm \{e\} \^\{\textbackslash mathrm \{i\} \textbackslash mathbf \{k\} \textbackslash cdot \textbackslash mathbf \{r\} \}u(\textbackslash mathbf \{r\} )\}    where r is position, {$\psi$} is the Bloch wave, u is a periodic function with the same periodicity as the crystal, k is a vector of real numbers called the crystal wave vector, e is Euler's number, and i is the imaginary unit. In other words, if you multiply a plane wave by a periodic function, you get a Bloch wave. Bloch waves are important because of Bloch's theorem, which states that the energy eigenstates for an electron in a crystal can be written as Bloch waves. (More precisely, it states that the electron wave functions in a crystal have a basis consisting entirely of Bloch wave energy eigenstates.) This fact underlies the concept of electronic band structures. These Bloch wave energy eigenstates are written with subscripts as {$\psi$}n k, where n is a discrete index, called the band index, which is present because there are many different Bloch waves with the same k (each has a different periodic component u). Within a band (i.e., for fixed n), {$\psi$}n k varies continuously with k, as does its energy. Also, for any reciprocal lattice vector K, {$\psi$}n k = {$\psi$}n,(k+K). Therefore, all distinct Bloch waves occur for k-values within the first Brillouin zone of the reciprocal lattice.},

The characteristics of OEOs are compared with other traditional RF oscillators, such as quartz, surface acoustic waves, and oscillators with electromagnetic wave cavities. Special attention is paid to Q-factors and phase noises of RF carriers at small offsets. The authors discuss the technical characteristics of modern optoelectronic methods for precision RF oscillation formation, such as commercial large-dimension and compact quantum frequency standards with optical pumping on cesium and rubidium cells.

  abstract = {Modern ultrafast metrology relies on the postulate that the pulse to be measured is fully coherent, that is, that it can be completely described by its spectrum and spectral phase. However, synthesizing fully coherent pulses is not always possible in practice, especially in the domain of emerging ultrashort X-ray sources where temporal metrology is strongly needed. Here we demonstrate how frequency-resolved optical gating (FROG), the first and one of the most widespread techniques for pulse characterization, can be adapted to measure partially coherent pulses even down to the attosecond timescale. No modification of experimental apparatuses is required; only the processing of the measurement changes. To do so, we take our inspiration from other branches of physics where partial coherence is routinely dealt with, such as quantum optics and coherent diffractive imaging. This will have important and immediate applications, such as enabling the measurement of X-ray free-electron laser pulses despite timing jitter.},

  abstract = {Laser-dressed photoemission spectroscopy has established itself as the gold standard of attosecond temporal metrology. In this technique, the attosecond structure of an extreme-ultraviolet pulse is retrieved from the wave function of the electron wave packet released during photoionization. Here, we show that this electron wave packet should rather be described using the density matrix formalism, thus allowing one to account for all processes that can affect its coherence, from the attosecond pulse generation to the photoemission and the measurement processes. Using this approach, we reconstruct experimentally a partially coherent electron wave packet with a purity of 0.11 (1 for full coherence). Comparison with theoretical models then allows us to identify the origins of this decoherence and to overcome several limitations such as beam-line instabilities or spectrometer resolution. Furthermore, we show numerically how this method gives access to the coherence and eigencomponents of complex photoelectron wave packets. It thus goes beyond the current measurement of photoionization time delays and provides a general framework for the analysis and understanding of complex photoemission processes.},

  abstract = {The rise time of intense radiation determines the maximum field strength atoms can be exposed to before their polarizability dramatically drops due to the detachment of an outer electron. Recent progress in ultrafast optics has allowed the generation of ultraintense light pulses comprising merely a few field oscillation cycles. The arising intensity gradient allows electrons to survive in their bound atomic state up to external field strengths many times higher than the binding Coulomb field and gives rise to ionization rates comparable to the light frequency, resulting in a significant extension of the frontiers of nonlinear optics and (nonrelativistic) high-field physics. Implications include the generation of coherent harmonic radiation up to kiloelectronvolt photon energies and control of the atomic dipole moment on a subfemtosecond (1 fs=10-15 s) time scale. This review presents the landmarks of the 30-odd-year evolution of ultrashort-pulse laser physics and technology culminating in the generation of intense few-cycle light pulses and discusses the impact of these pulses on high-field physics. Particular emphasis is placed on high-order harmonic emission and single subfemtosecond extreme ultraviolet/x-ray pulse generation. These as well as other strong-field processes are governed directly by the electric-field evolution, and hence their full control requires access to the (absolute) phase of the light carrier. We shall discuss routes to its determination and control, which will, for the first time, allow access to the electromagnetic fields in light waves and control of high-field interactions with never-before-achieved precision.},

  abstract = {Manipulation of quantum interference requires that the system under control remains coherent, avoiding (or at least postponing) the phase randomization that can ensue from coupling to an uncontrolled environment. We show that closed-loop coherent control can be used to mitigate the rate of quantum dephasing in a gas-phase ensemble of potassium dimers (K2), which acts as a model system for testing the general concepts of controlling decoherence. Specifically, we adaptively shaped the light pulse used to prepare a vibrational wave packet in electronically excited K2, with the amplitude of quantum beats in the fluorescence signal used as an easily measured surrogate for the purpose of optimizing coherence. The optimal pulse increased the beat amplitude from below the noise level to well above it, and thereby increased the coherence life time as compared with the beats produced by a transform-limited pulse. Closed-loop methods can thus effectively identify states that are robust against dephasing without any previous information about the system-environment interaction. Iterative shaping of a laser pulse using feedback from a fluorescence signal extends the phase stability of a molecular vibration in the face of rotational jostling.

Brasch et al. generated optical frequency combs on an optical chip (see the Perspective by Akhmediev and Devine). They induced an optical soliton, or optical bullet, and propagated it in an engineered microcavity waveguide. The emitted output light formed a coherent comb of frequencies spanning two-thirds of an octave. Such an on-chip demonstration bodes well for miniaturization of metrological technology and its adaption for widespread application. Science, this issue p. 357; see also p. 340 Optical solitons are propagating pulses of light that retain their shape because nonlinearity and dispersion balance each other. In the presence of higher-order dispersion, optical solitons can emit dispersive waves via the process of soliton Cherenkov radiation. This process underlies supercontinuum generation and is of critical importance in frequency metrology. Using a continuous wave\textendash pumped, dispersion-engineered, integrated silicon nitride microresonator, we generated continuously circulating temporal dissipative Kerr solitons. The presence of higher-order dispersion led to the emission of red-shifted soliton Cherenkov radiation. The output corresponds to a fully coherent optical frequency comb that spans two-thirds of an octave and whose phase we were able to stabilize to the sub-Hertz level. By preserving coherence over a broad spectral bandwidth, our device offers the opportunity to develop compact on-chip frequency combs for frequency metrology or spectroscopy. A broadband and coherent frequency comb is generated with an optical microresonator.

ISO thin films were grown on (100) p-type Si substrates using DC and RF magnetron co-sputtering deposition. Post-deposition thermal annealing was performed resulting in a large tunability of the optical dispersion data as measured directly by variable-angle ellipsometry. ENZ wavelengths in the range 1.7 {$\mu$}m - 5.8 {$\mu$}m were experimentally obtained depending on the annealing conditions. Moreover, ISO films with 350 nm thickness were investigated by atomic force microscopy that reveals a minimum rms roughness of approximately 1.1 nm, enabling high-quality nanofabrication. In order to demonstrate the potential of ISO thin films for infrared plasmonic device applications, we have fabricated nanoparticle disk arrays using electron-beam lithography on Al2 O3 substrates and showed, using both Finite Element Method simulations as well as reflection spectroscopy, distinctive plasmonic resonances at mid-infrared wavelengths tuned by the nanoparticles' spacing and aspect ratio. The development of fully Si-compatible plasmonic materials with engineered optical dispersion is important to enable cost-effective photonic-plasmonic high-density integration and provides novel opportunities for metamaterials research.},

One application of particular interest is the detection of an incident optical pulse's carrier\textendash envelope phase (CEP). Such CEP detection requires few-cycle, broadband optical excitation where the resonant properties of the nanoantenna can strongly alter the response of the near field in time. Little quantitative investigation has been performed to understand how the geometry and resonant properties of the antennas should be tuned to enhance the CEP sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio. Here we examine how the geometry and resonance frequency of planar plasmonic nanoantennas can be engineered to enhance the emitted CEP-sensitive photocurrent when driven by a few-cycle optical pulse. We find that with the simple addition of curved sidewalls leading to the apex, and proper tuning of the resonance wavelength, the net CEP-sensitive current per nanoantenna can be improved by 5-10\texttimes, and the signal-to-noise-ratio by 50-100\texttimes{} relative to simple triangular antennas operated on resonance. Our findings will inform the next generation of nanoantenna designs for emerging applications in ultrafast photoelectron metrology and petahertz electronics.},

Bandwidths for the radiation from these gratings were measured and found to be dependent upon the number of grating grooves as well as the beam angle of incidence. This is interpreted as indicating a one-to-one correspondence between grooves in the grating and undulations in the radiated wave train produced by a single passing electron. With this assumption, a height for the zone of effective interaction for the electron is calculated to be {$\sim$}1500 \AA{} from the grating surface.},

For symmetric structures ({$\epsilon$}1={$\epsilon$}3), there are the usual two Fano modes whose velocity and attenuation vary with film thickness. For very thin films, one of these modes can attain multicentimeter propagation distances when {$\lambda>$}1 {$\mu$}m. In addition, there are two leaky waves which correspond to waves localized at the {$\epsilon$}1 (or {$\epsilon$}3) dielectric-metal interface whose fields decay exponentially across the metal film and radiate an angular spectrum of plane waves into {$\epsilon$}3 (or {$\epsilon$}1, respectively). Both radiative waves can be interpreted as spatial transients, which could have physical significance near a transverse plane. When {$\epsilon$}1{$\neq\epsilon$}3, there are still four distinct solutions for a given film thickness, two radiative and two nonradiative. For lossy films, there are always two nonradiative solutions for thick enough films. As the thickness goes to infinity, the four solutions reduce to two waves, each radiative and nonradiative pair becoming degenerate. The physical interpretation of these solutions and their dependence on dielectric constant and wavelength are discussed.},

Interestingly, minute geometry asymmetry and surface roughness are clearly revealed by far-field analysis, demonstrating that second harmonic generation is a promising tool for the sensitive optical characterization of plasmonic nanostructures. Furthermore, defects located where the linear field is strong (e.g., in the antenna gap) do not necessarily have the strongest impact on the second harmonic signal.},

We analyze the influence of atomic gas media (Ar, Kr, or Xe), gas pressure, and interaction geometries (a gas jet and a finite and a semi-infinite gas cell). Numerical simulations allow us to define optimal conditions for HHG in this tight focusing regime and to observe the signature of on-axis phase matching. These conditions are implemented experimentally using a high-repetition-rate Yb-doped fiber laser system. We achieve optimization of emission with a recorded XUV photon flux of 4.5\texttimes 1012\,\,photons/s generated in Xe at 100~kHz repetition rate.},

Symmetric and antisymmetric plasmon modes are found to be more easily excited in thick and thin films, respectively, and in particular leaky plasmons in supported films are shown to be excited with very large probability exceeding one plasmon per electron. Generation of guided plasmons in metallic particle arrays is also proved to be attainable by aiming the electron at one end of the waveguide. The temporal evolution and spectral distribution of excited plasmons are discussed as well. Our results provide full support for the application of electron bombardment to excite propagating plasmons with high efficiency, thus solving the standing problem of plasmon generation at designated locations.},

  abstract = {Detection jitter quantifies variance introduced by the detector in the determination of photon arrival time. It is a crucial performance parameter for systems using superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs). In this work, we have demonstrated that the detection timing jitter is limited in part by the spatial variation of the photon detection events along the length of the wire. We define this jitter source as a geometric jitter since it is related to the length and area of the SNSPD. To characterize the geometric jitter, we have constructed a differential cryogenic readout with less than 7 ps of an electronic jitter that can amplify the pulses generated from the two ends of an SNSPD. By differencing the measured arrival times of the two electrical pulses, we were able to partially cancel out the difference of the propagation times and thus reduce the uncertainty of the photon arrival time. We proved that the variation of the differential propagation time was a few ps for a 3 {$\mu$}m \texttimes\,3\,{$\mu$}m device, while it increased up to 50 ps for a 20 {$\mu$}m \texttimes\,20\,{$\mu$}m device. In a 20\,{$\mu$}m\,\texttimes\,20\,{$\mu$}m large SNSPD, we achieved a 20\% reduction in the overall detection timing jitter for detecting the telecom-wavelength photons by using the differential cryogenic readout.},

The ability to initiate and observe such electronic dynamics in polyatomic molecules represents a crucial step forward in attosecond science, which is progressively moving toward the investigation of more and more complex systems.Over the past decade, laser technology has pushed back the fastest directly observable time scale from femtoseconds (quadrillionths of a second) to attoseconds (quintillionths of a second).

Furthermore, lifetimes of the photoexcited electrons can be fitted well by the Fermi-liquid theory with a scaling factor plus an effective upper lifetime. This observation enables separation of electron-electron scattering, and to a lesser extent electron-phonon scattering, processes from electron-transport effects on the surface dynamics.},

The imaging detector provides direct access to the diffraction pattern, while the integrating detector can be synchronized to the microscope scan generator providing access to a real space image generated by integrating (pixel-by-pixel) a portion of the diffraction pattern as quantitatively defined by the DMD. The DMD, in effect, takes the place of the objective aperture in a transmission electron microscope (TEM) or an annular detector in a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM), but has the distinct advantage that it can be programmed to take any shape in real time.

  abstract = {Making ultrafast cycles of light The ability to generate coherent optical frequency combs has had a huge impact on precision metrology, imaging, and sensing applications. On closer inspection, the broadband ``white light'' generated through the interaction of femtosecond mode-locked laser pulses is composed of billions or trillions of precisely spaced wavelengths of light. Carlson et al. demonstrate an alternative to the mode-locked laser approach\textemdash the electro-optic modulation of a continuous-wave laser light source can also generate optical frequency combs (see the Perspective by Torres-Company). The electro-optic modulation techniques can operate at much higher repetition rates than mode-locked lasers, which means they could potentially yield even more precise measurements. Science, this issue p. 1358; see also p. 1316 Light sources that are ultrafast and ultrastable enable applications like timing with subfemtosecond precision and control of quantum and classical systems. Mode-locked lasers have often given access to this regime, by using their high pulse energies. We demonstrate an adaptable method for ultrastable control of low-energy femtosecond pulses based on common electro-optic modulation of a continuous-wave laser light source. We show that we can obtain 100-picojoule pulse trains at rates up to 30 gigahertz and demonstrate sub\textendash optical cycle timing precision and useful output spectra spanning the near infrared. Our source enters the few-cycle ultrafast regime without mode locking, and its high speed provides access to nonlinear measurements and rapid transients. Electro-optic modulation of a continuous-wave laser is used to produce ultrafast and ultrastable optical frequency combs.

Narrow-band THz radiation can be produced by free-electron lasers1 and fast diodes2,3. Broadband THz radiation can be produced by thermal sources and, more recently, by table-top laser-driven sources4,5,6 and by short electron bunches in accelerators7, but so far only with low power. Here we report calculations and measurements that confirm the production of high-power broadband THz radiation from subpicosecond electron bunches in an accelerator. The average power is nearly 20\,watts, several orders of magnitude higher than any existing source, which could enable various new applications. In particular, many materials have distinct absorptive and dispersive properties in this spectral range, so that THz imaging could reveal interesting features. For example, it would be possible to image the distribution of specific proteins or water in tissue, or buried metal layers in semiconductors8,9; the present source would allow full-field, real-time capture of such images. High peak and average power THz sources are also critical in driving new nonlinear phenomena and for pump\textendash probe studies of dynamical properties of materials10,11.},

For single photoemission time delays the most common techniques are based on attosecond streaking and the reconstruction of attosecond beating by interference of two-photon transitions (RABBITT). These are pump-probe techniques employing an extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) single attosecond pump pulse for streaking or an attosecond pump pulse train for RABBITT, and a phase-locked infrared (IR) probe pulse. These techniques can only extract relative timing information between electrons originating from different initial states within the same atom or different atoms. Here we address the question whether the two techniques give identical timing information. We present a complete study, supported by both experiments and simulations, comparing these two techniques for the measurement of the photoemission time delay difference between valence electrons emitted from the Ne 2p and Ar 3p ground states. We highlight not only the differences and similarities between the two techniques, but also critically investigate the reliability of the methods used to extract the timing information.},

  abstract = {Capturing electronic dynamics in real time has been the ultimate goal of attosecond science since its beginning. While for atomic targets the existing measurement techniques have been thoroughly validated, in molecules there are open questions due to the inevitable copresence of moving nuclei, which are not always mere spectators of the phototriggered electron dynamics. Previous work has shown that not only can nuclear motion affect the way electrons move in a molecule, but it can also lead to contradictory interpretations depending on the chosen experimental approach. In this Letter we investigate how nuclear motion affects and eventually distorts the electronic dynamics measured by using two of the most popular attosecond techniques, reconstruction of attosecond beating by interference of two-photon transitions and attosecond streaking. Both methods are employed, in combination with ab initio theoretical calculations, to retrieve photoionization delays in the dissociative ionization of H2, H2\textrightarrow H++H+e-, in the region of the Q1 series of autoionizing states, where nuclear motion plays a prominent role. We find that the experimental reconstruction of attosecond beating by interference of two-photon transitions results are very sensitive to bond softening around the Q1 threshold (27.8 eV), even at relatively low infrared (IR) intensity (I0{$\sim$}1.4\texttimes 1011 W/cm2), due to the long duration of the probe pulse that is inherent to this technique. Streaking, on the other hand, seems to be a better choice to isolate attosecond electron dynamics, since shorter pulses can be used, thus reducing the role of bond softening. This conclusion is supported by very good agreement between our streaking measurements and the results of accurate theoretical calculations. Additionally, the streaking technique offers the necessary energy resolution to accurately retrieve the fast-oscillating phase of the photoionization matrix elements, an essential requirement for extending this technique to even more complicated molecular targets.},

These devices are compact and integratable solid-state detectors operating at optical frequencies under ambient conditions using low pulse energies (picojoule-level). Potential applications include frequency-comb stabilization, optical time-domain spectroscopy, compact tools for attosecond science and metrology, and petahertz-scale information processing. However, to date these devices have been driven by free-space optical waveforms and their implementation within integrated photonic platforms has yet to be demonstrated. In this work, we design and simulate fully-integrated plasmonic nanoantennas coupled to a SiN-core waveguide for CEP detection. We find that when coupled to realistic on-chip, few-cycle supercontinuum sources, these devices are suitable for direct time-domain CEP detection within integrated photonic platforms. We estimate a signal-to-noise ratio of 30 dB at 50 kHz resolution bandwidth, and address technical details, such as the tuning of the nanoantennas plasmonic resonance, CEP slippage in the waveguide, optical losses, and sensitivity to driving pulse characteristics such as energy and duration. Our results provide the basis for future design and fabrication of time-domain CEP detectors and allow for the development of fully-integrated attosecond science applications, frequency-comb stabilization and light-wave-based PHz electronics.},

Yet it remains challenging to probe electronic processes, many of which take place in the attosecond (1 as = 10-18 s) regime. In contrast, atomic motion occurs on the femtosecond (1 fs = 10-15 s) timescale and has been mapped in solids in real time using femtosecond X-ray sources. Here we extend the attosecond techniques previously used to study isolated atoms in the gas phase to observe electron motion in condensed-matter systems and on surfaces in real time. We demonstrate our ability to obtain direct time-domain access to charge dynamics with attosecond resolution by probing photoelectron emission from single-crystal tungsten. Our data reveal a delay of approximately 100 attoseconds between the emission of photoelectrons that originate from localized core states of the metal, and those that are freed from delocalized conduction-band states. These results illustrate that attosecond metrology constitutes a powerful tool for exploring not only gas-phase systems, but also fundamental electronic processes occurring on the attosecond timescale in condensed-matter systems and on surfaces.},

Instead, absorbed light in one of the metals can produce a current of hot electrons when the incident photon energy exceeds the oxide barrier energy. Despite the desirable traits of convenient fabrication and room-temperature operation at zero bias of this type of device, the low power conversion efficiency has limited its use. Here, we demonstrate the benefits of reshaping one of the metallic contacts into a plasmonic stripe antenna. We use measurements of the voltage-dependence, spectral-dependence, stripe-width dependence, and polarization-dependence of the photocurrent to show that surface plasmon excitations can result in a favorable redistribution in the electric fields in the stripe that enhances the photocurrent. We also provide a theoretical model that quantifies the spectral photocurrent in terms of the electrical and optical properties of the junction. This model provides an accurate estimate of the bias dependence of the external quantum efficiency of different devices and shows that both the spatial and vectorial properties of the electric field distribution are important to its operation.},

  abstract = {The response of a particle in a periodic potential to an applied force is commonly described by an effective mass, which accounts for the detailed interaction between the particle and the surrounding potential. Using a Bose-Einstein condensate of 87Rb atoms initially in the ground band of an optical lattice, we experimentally show that the initial response of a particle to an applied force is in fact characterized by the bare mass. Subsequently, the particle response undergoes rapid oscillations and only over time scales that are long compared to those of the interband dynamics is the effective mass observed to be an appropriate description. Our results elucidate the role of the effective mass on short time scales, which is relevant for example in the interaction of few-cycle laser pulses with dielectric and semiconductor materials.},

Even in nonlinear optical media, in which two beams can interact because of their influence on the medium's refractive index, this interaction is weak at low light levels. Here, we propose a novel approach to realizing strong nonlinear interactions at the single-photon level, by exploiting the strong coupling between individual optical emitters and propagating surface plasmons confined to a conducting nanowire. We show that this system can act as a nonlinear two-photon switch for incident photons propagating along the nanowire, which can be coherently controlled using conventional quantum-optical techniques. Furthermore, we discuss how the interaction can be tailored to create a single-photon transistor, where the presence (or absence) of a single incident photon in a `gate' field is sufficient to allow (or prevent) the propagation of subsequent `signal' photons along the wire.},

FECs consume less power, respond faster, and tolerate lower vacuum than thermionic cathodes used in conventional X-ray generators. The use of a transmission anode, instead of a conventional reflection anode, allows filtering of the background radiation (brems strahlung) while allowing efficient generation of X-rays at lower voltages by exciting atomic shell transitions, resulting in emission of X-rays with narrow spectral linewidth for sharper imaging of biological tissue. The fabricated FEC contains arrays of self-aligned, gated field emitters that turn on at bias voltages under 30 V and transmit 99.5\% of the electrons to the anode. The FEC emits a maximum current of 1.2 {$\mu$}A per field emitter (588 {$\mu$}A total array current) at a bias voltage of 85 V. A facility is built and tested to generate X-rays with an FEC and a transmission anode. Using the facility, we obtained an X-ray absorption image of an ex-vivos ample that clearly shows softtissue and fine bone structures.},

This rectifying behaviour was attributed to the formation of a Schottky contact between the Au coated atomic force microscopy (AFM) tip and ZnO nanorod (nano-M/SC) which was dominated by the surface states in ZnO itself. Photo-assisted conductive AFM (PC-AFM) was used to demonstrate how the I-V characteristics are influenced by the surface states. Our I-V results also showed that the nano-M/SCs had a good photo-electric switching effect at reverse bias.}

First-principles calculation results reveal that the G/hBN bilayer extends the HHG properties of the constituent layers. Harmonic intensity can be significantly enhanced by several orders of magnitude by tuning the Berry curvature of G/hBN via pressure-controlled interlayer interaction. The result offers a new way to enhance HHG in graphene. It also demonstrates that van der Waals heterostructures and their novel degrees of freedom can be used to control the HHG process and open up more possibilities to manipulate strong-field ultrafast physical properties in such 2D materials.},

This is achieved using phase-modulated compact axilens devices that simultaneously focus incident radiation of selected wavelengths at predefined locations with larger focal depths compared to traditional Fresnel lenses. In addition, the proposed devices are polarization insensitive and maintain a large focusing efficiency over a broad spectral band. Specifically, here we discuss and characterize modulated axilens configurations designed for long-wavelength infrared (LWIR) in the \$6\textasciitilde\textbackslash mu\$m--12\textasciitilde\$\textbackslash mu\$m wavelength range and in the \$4\textasciitilde\textbackslash mu\$m--6\textasciitilde\$\textbackslash mu\$m mid-wavelength infrared (MWIR) range. These devices are ideally suited for monolithic integration atop the substrate layers of infrared focal plane arrays (IR-FPAs) and for use as compact microspectrometers. We systematically study their focusing efficiency, spectral response, and cross talk ratio, and we demonstrate linear control of multi-wavelength focusing on a single plane. Our design method leverages Rayleigh-Sommerfeld (RS) diffraction theory and is validated numerically using the Finite Element Method (FEM). Finally, we demonstrate the application of spatially modulated axilenses to the realization of compact, single-lens spectrometer. By optimizing our devices, we achieve a minimum distinguishable wavelength interval of \$\textbackslash Delta\textbackslash lambda=240nm\$ at \$\textbackslash lambda\_0=8\{\textbackslash mu\}m\$ and \$\textbackslash Delta\textbackslash lambda=165nm\$ at \$\textbackslash lambda\_0=5\{\textbackslash mu\}m\$.

The artifact is found to be correlated with random laser-intensity fluctuations in the experimental setup. We, therefore, remediate this issue by implementing single-shot tagging of the laser pulse energy in addition to the present CEP tagging technique in order to assign a corresponding (pulse-averaged) laser intensity to each detected photoelectron for every laser shot. After applying intensity filtering and an appropriate intensity correction, we demonstrate the capability of detecting weak CEP-dependent photoemission from a bulk tungsten surface with a modulation depth as low as approximately 1\% within a measurement time of approximately 30 min at a 10-kHz repetition rate. Our approach has proven successful in increasing the sensitivity of the single-shot CEP tagging technique, which allows the studies of weak CEP effects in atoms, molecules, and solids.}

  abstract = {Emission current stability and the spatial uniformity of field emission devices are improved when a lightly doped drain MOSFET (LD-MOSFET) is integrated with a field emission array (FEA). At comparable current levels, the emission noise ({$\Delta$}I/I) decreased from 16.9\% to 1.8\%. Emission current fluctuation was reduced in the integrated device compared to the FEA device even in the presence of gases. Spatial current uniformity was achieved in the integrated MOSFET/FEA devices at different wafer positions and for different array sizes. The results are explained by a two-step field emission process, which consists of an electron supply step determined by the MOSFET inversion layer and an electron transmission step determined by the field emission barrier width. The device structure also results in low voltage control of emission current.},

However, the available techniques for attosecond pulse measurement are valid only for narrow-bandwidth spectra, due to one of the key approximations made in the phase retrieval. Here we report a new technique for characterizing attosecond pulses, whereby the spectral phase of the attosecond pulse is extracted from the oscillation component with the dressing laser frequency in the photoelectron spectrogram. This technique, termed PROOF (Phase Retrieval by Omega Oscillation Filtering), can be applied to characterizing attosecond pulses with ultrabroad bandwidths.},

  abstract = {We apply the strong field approximation (SFA) to the study of harmonic generation (HG) and above threshold ionization (ATI) in intense low-frequency laser fields. We review in a systematic way the SFA model from the literature to date, and fill in some gaps regarding its analytical and computational aspects. Special attention is devoted to the analysis of the saddle point method, which is widely used to calculate the highly oscillatory integrals describing the physical processes. Its accuracy is compared against the results from numerical integration; for the latter task, we propose two methods, which prove to be fast and reliable for all practical purposes. In the context of HG, we discuss non-dipole effects, using a non-dipole non-relativistic method. The use of a second, weaker laser pulse is shown to allow the emission enhancement of selected harmonics. We briefly discuss the importance of relativistic effects using the results of a fully relativistic calculation of Milo\textasciicaron sevi\textasciiacute c et al.. In the context of ATI, quantitative comparisons are made with results obtained by integrating the exact static ionization rates over the pulse or, where possible, with ab initio results. Direct ionization in short pulses is extensively presented in the framework of a Coulomb-corrected version of the SFA, due to Krainov; interesting interference effects are shown to take place, in particular modulations in the angle-resolved ATI spectra depending strongly on the phase of the carrier. These modulations happen for pulses that are not too long, typically fewer than (9-10) optical cycles. As a consequence, the ATI peaks in the 2 angle-integrated spectra have a good resolution or are undistinguishable from the background, if the electric field component of the pulse is symmetrical or anti-symmetrical with respect to the pulse half duration, respectively. Partial conclusions are drawn regarding the applicability of the SFA to the study of the ionization process and possible ways to further improve the model are suggested.},

Modulation of resonant frequency (740?1620 cm?1) is accomplished by varying nanowire length (135?1160 nm). The observed frequency shift is consistent with Mie?Gans theory, which indicates electrically active dopant concentrations between 1019 and 1020 cm?3.

In fact, our numerical simulations reveal that high-energy electrons can be generated. Specifically, using a linear approximation for the spatial dependence of the enhanced plasmonic field and with a near-infrared laser with intensities in the mid 1014 W/cm2 range, we show it is possible to drive electrons with energies in the near-keV regime.

  abstract = {Recently two emerging areas of research, attosecond and nanoscale physics, have started to come together. Attosecond physics deals with phenomena occurring when ultrashort laser pulses, with duration on the femto- and sub-femtosecond time scales, interact with atoms, molecules or solids. The laser-induced electron dynamics occurs natively on a timescale down to a few hundred or even tens of attoseconds (1 attosecond = 1 as = 10 -18 s), which is comparable with the optical field. For comparison, the revolution of an electron on a 1s orbital of a hydrogen atom is {$\sim$}152 as. On the other hand, the second branch involves the manipulation and engineering of mesoscopic systems, such as solids, metals and dielectrics, with nanometric precision. Although nano-engineering is a vast and well-established research field on its own, the merger with intense laser physics is relatively recent. In this report on progress we present a comprehensive experimental and theoretical overview of physics that takes place when short and intense laser pulses interact with nanosystems, such as metallic and dielectric nanostructures. In particular we elucidate how the spatially inhomogeneous laser induced fields at a nanometer scale modify the laser-driven electron dynamics. Consequently, this has important impact on pivotal processes such as above-threshold ionization and high-order harmonic generation. The deep understanding of the coupled dynamics between these spatially inhomogeneous fields and matter configures a promising way to new avenues of research and applications. Thanks to the maturity that attosecond physics has reached, together with the tremendous advance in material engineering and manipulation techniques, the age of atto-nanophysics has begun, but it is in the initial stage. We present thus some of the open questions, challenges and prospects for experimental confirmation of theoretical predictions, as well as experiments aimed at characterizing the induced fields and the unique electron dynamics initiated by them with high temporal and spatial resolution.},

If recollision exists, it should be possible to convert the energy gained by the electron in the continuum in a high-energy photon. Consequently, the emission of harmonic radiation appears to be viable. We employ a quantum mechanical time-dependent approach to model the electron dipole moment including both the laser experimental conditions and the bulk matter properties. The use of metal tips should provide an alternative way of generating coherent XUV light with a femtosecond laser field.},

  abstract = {The development of the optical frequency comb (a spectrum consisting of a series of evenly spaced lines) has revolutionized metrology and precision spectroscopy owing to its ability to provide a precise and direct link between microwave and optical frequencies. A further advance in frequency comb technology is the generation of frequency combs in the extreme-ultraviolet spectral range by means of high-harmonic generation in a femtosecond enhancement cavity. Until now, combs produced by this method have lacked sufficient power for applications, a drawback that has also hampered efforts to observe phase coherence of the high-repetition-rate pulse train produced by high-harmonic generation, which is an extremely nonlinear process. Here we report the generation of extreme-ultraviolet frequency combs, reaching wavelengths of 40\,nanometres, by coupling a high-power near-infrared frequency comb to a robust femtosecond enhancement cavity. These combs are powerful enough for us to observe single-photon spectroscopy signals for both an argon transition at 82\,nanometres and a neon transition at 63\,nanometres, thus confirming the combs/' coherence in the extreme ultraviolet. The absolute frequency of the argon transition has been determined by direct frequency comb spectroscopy. The resolved ten-megahertz linewidth of the transition, which is limited by the temperature of the argon atoms, is unprecedented in this spectral region and places a stringent upper limit on the linewidth of individual comb teeth. Owing to the lack of continuous-wave lasers, extreme-ultraviolet frequency combs are at present the only promising route to extending ultrahigh-precision spectroscopy to the spectral region below 100\,nanometres. At such wavelengths there is a wide range of applications, including the spectroscopy of electronic transitions in molecules, experimental tests of bound-state and many-body quantum electrodynamics in singly ionized helium and neutral helium, the development of next-generation /`nuclear/' clocks and searches for variation of fundamental constants using the enhanced sensitivity of highly charged ions.},

By tuning the central wavelength of the driver source, the high-order harmonic spectra in the extreme ultraviolet cover the full range of photon energy between {$\sim$}25 and {$\sim$}100 eV.

  abstract = {Watching a single molecule move on its intrinsic timescale has been one of the central goals of modern nanoscience, and calls for measurements that combine ultrafast temporal resolution with atomic spatial resolution. Steady-state experiments access the requisite spatial scales, as illustrated by direct imaging of individual molecular orbitals using scanning tunnelling microscopy or the acquisition of tip-enhanced Raman and luminescence spectra with sub-molecular resolution. But tracking the intrinsic dynamics of a single molecule directly in the time domain faces the challenge that interactions with the molecule must be confined to a femtosecond time window. For individual nanoparticles, such ultrafast temporal confinement has been demonstrated by combining scanning tunnelling microscopy with so-called lightwave electronics, which uses the oscillating carrier wave of tailored light pulses to directly manipulate electronic motion on timescales faster even than a single cycle of light. Here we build on ultrafast terahertz scanning tunnelling microscopy to access a state-selective tunnelling regime, where the peak of a terahertz electric-field waveform transiently opens an otherwise forbidden tunnelling channel through a single molecular state. It thereby removes a single electron from an individual pentacene molecule's highest occupied molecular orbital within a time window shorter than one oscillation cycle of the terahertz wave. We exploit this effect to record approximately 100-femtosecond snapshot images of the orbital structure with sub-\aa ngstr\"om spatial resolution, and to reveal, through pump/probe measurements, coherent molecular vibrations at terahertz frequencies directly in the time domain. We anticipate that the combination of lightwave electronics and the atomic resolution of our approach will open the door to visualizing ultrafast photochemistry and the operation of molecular electronics on the single-orbital scale.},

High-harmonic generation, multiphoton two-electron ejection, and very high energy above-threshold-ionization electrons are all conssequences of this electron-ion interaction. One important parameter which determines the strength of these effects is the rate at which the wave packet spreads in the direction perpendicular to the laser electric field; another is the polarization of the laser.

One would think that this article is about particle physics and yet it is not, as this process can occur fairly easily on a day to day basis in an optics laboratory. Nowadays, SPDC is at the heart of many quantum optics experiments for applications in quantum cryptography, quantum simulation, quantum metrology but also for testing fundamentals laws of physics in quantum mechanics. In this article, we will focus on the physics of this process and highlight a few important properties of SPDC. There will be two parts: a first theoretical one showing the particular quantum nature of SPDC, and the second part, more experimental and in particular focusing on applications of parametric down-conversion. This is clearly a non-exhaustive article about parametric down-conversion as there is a tremendous literature on the subject, but it gives the necessary first elements needed for a novice student or researcher to work on SPDC sources of light.},

  abstract = {In signal processing, cross-correlation is a measure of similarity of two series as a function of the displacement of one relative to the other. This is also known as a sliding dot product or sliding inner-product. It is commonly used for searching a long signal for a shorter, known feature. It has applications in pattern recognition, single particle analysis, electron tomography, averaging, cryptanalysis, and neurophysiology. The cross-correlation is similar in nature to the convolution of two functions.  In an autocorrelation, which is the cross-correlation of a signal with itself, there will always be a peak at a lag of zero, and its size will be the signal energy. In probability and statistics, the term cross-correlations refers to the correlations between the entries of two random vectors                                    X                          \{\textbackslash displaystyle \textbackslash mathbf \{X\} \}    and                                    Y                          \{\textbackslash displaystyle \textbackslash mathbf \{Y\} \}   , while the correlations of a random vector                                    X                          \{\textbackslash displaystyle \textbackslash mathbf \{X\} \}    are the correlations between the entries of                                    X                          \{\textbackslash displaystyle \textbackslash mathbf \{X\} \}    itself, those forming the correlation matrix of                                    X                          \{\textbackslash displaystyle \textbackslash mathbf \{X\} \}   .

The question naturally arises whether one can induce few-cycle localized plasmon oscillations in optical near-fields. Here, we perform a comparative study of different plasmonic nanoresonators illuminated by few-cycle pulses. We analyze the number of cycles (NOC) of the plasmonic field, the near-field enhancement (NFE) as well as the figure of merit NFE/NOC. The pulse length dependence of these quantities is also investigated. Throughout the inspected pulse-length interval silica-gold and silica-silver core\textendash shell monomers have the potential to preserve the NOC of the incoming pulse, silver bow-ties result in the highest NFE, whereas gold core\textendash shell dimers have the highest NFE/NOC. Based on the analysis, silver bow-ties, gold core\textendash shell and silver nanorod dimers proved to be the most suitable for few-cycle near-field amplification.},

In these devices, capacitance limits operating frequency. Custer et al. describe a diode made entirely of silicon that can rectify currents up to 40 gigahertz at room temperature. They fabricated silicon nanowires with a cylindrical sawtooth profile that act as ratchets, funneling current preferentially in one direction through specular reflection of quasi-ballistic electrons. Science, this issue p. 177 Ratcheting effects play an important role in systems ranging from mechanical socket wrenches to biological motor proteins. The underlying principle is to convert a fluctuating, unbiased force into unidirectional motion. Here, we report the ratcheting of electrons at room temperature using a semiconductor nanowire with precisely engineered asymmetry. Modulation of the nanowire diameter creates a cylindrical sawtooth geometry with broken inversion symmetry on a nanometer-length scale. In a two-terminal device, this structure responded as a three-dimensional geometric diode that funnels electrons preferentially in one direction through specular reflection of quasi-ballistic electrons at the nanowire surface. The ratcheting effect causes charge rectification at frequencies exceeding 40 gigahertz, demonstrating the potential for applications such as high-speed data processing and long-wavelength energy harvesting.

By contrast, quantum interactions of free electrons with light have only become accessible in recent years, following the discovery of photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM). So far, the fundamental free electron\textendash light interaction in all PINEM experiments has remained weak due to its localized near-field nature, which imposes an energy\textendash momentum mismatch between electrons and light. Here, we demonstrate a strong interaction between free-electron waves and light waves, resulting from precise energy\textendash momentum phase-matching with the extended propagating light field. By exchanging hundreds of photons with the field, each electron simultaneously accelerates and decelerates in a coherent manner. Consequently, each electron's quantum wavefunction evolves into a quantized energy comb, spanning a bandwidth of over 1,700\,eV, requiring us to extend the PINEM theory. Our observation of coherent electron phase-matching with a propagating wave is a type of inverse-Cherenkov interaction that occurs with a quantum electron wavefunction, demonstrating how the extended nature of the electron wavefunction can alter stimulated electron\textendash light interactions.},

  abstract = {A reproducible time sequence of different pattern types has been found to appear in electron projector images of field emission from tungsten single crystals when the crystals are kept at temperatures above 1100\textdegree K. These pattern types, some of which have been observed before and attributed to migrations of surface tungsten atoms, can best be explained (with a single possible exception) as the result of rearrangement of adsorbed gas atoms on certain crystallographic surface areas under the influence of temperature and field. Their classification by means of their relation to surface conditions provides a sensitive test for a clean tungsten surface. The relative variation of emission intensity with crystallographic direction observed in thermionic emission is duplicated in field emission from clean tungsten, but the magnitudes of the variations are greater in field emission. These magnitudes seem to be greater than can be accounted for by the dependence of field emission on the exponential third power of work function which is indicated by some experiments. Such experiments in turn are at variance with theory, which predicts only an exponential three-halves power dependence. Attempts to extend electron projector methods of investigation to the simple composite surface of thorium on tungsten have uncovered no positive tests for surface conditions. Distinctly different types of field emission patterns were obtained from thoriated points formed from thoria-incorporated tungsten wire than from points of pure tungsten upon which thorium was evaporated externally. These differences disappeared, however, when the former patterns transformed into the latter after outgassing of the points for one or two hours at temperatures between 2700\textdegree K and 2900\textdegree K. In this final pattern, thorium adsorbs chiefly on the regions around but not including the 100 direction, and on a triangular region about and including the 111 direction. Once deposited, the thorium could not be completely removed from the tungsten surface.},

The experimental results are compared to a phenomenological model of the harmonic generation process, incorporating two separate models of photo-onization. While the calculated phasematching pressure is generally insensitive to the ionization model, for the harmonic cut-off we obtain superior agreement between experiment and theory when the Yudin-Ivanov (YI) ionization model is used, compared to the commonly utilised Ammosov-Delone-Krainov (ADK) model.},
  note = {\section{Review}

\par
In this paper, entitled "Comparison of Strong-field Ionization Models in the Wavelength-scaling of High Harmonic Generation," Lloyd et al. present a concise, well-written study of high harmonic generation using femtosecond pulses and differing gas species with the aim of comparing the influence of the photoionization models when simulating the experimental results, specifically with regard to the optimal phase matching pressure and cutoff energy of the generated harmonics.~ Their results seem to support the conclusion that the Yudin-Ivanov provides a better approximation of photoionization in the high-harmonic generation process from noble gases. In my opinion, the manuscript is well formulated, timely, and suitable for publication in optics express.~ I have only a few minor comments that are listed below that I feel should be addressed before publication.
\par
(1) On page 2 the Keldysh parameter is written.~ While this might be a matter of depate, I would recommend defining the ponderamotive potential U\_p and writing the Keldysh parameter using this formulation as proportional to the square root of the ratio of the work function to the ponderomotive potential.~ This to me expresses more of the physical picture and is less cryptic than the current form used in the manuscript.~ Of course, you also already list the other interpretation regarding tunneling time, so I think this makes a better complement to that.
\par
(2) Since it is important to ensuring that you are always at or near the SF/tunneling regime (i.e. \textbackslash gamma {$<$} 1), it would be good to incorporate in some fashion the \textbackslash gamma value for each species/wavelength (with uncertainty).~ For instance, this could be incorporated as text in the sub-plots in Fig. 3. This also should be incorporated and referenced in later discussion/conclusion.
\par
(3) For table 1, it would be nice to also include the peak intensity as calculated, with uncertainty, for both wavelengths.
\par
(4) In Fig. 3d, can you comment on why you think for Kr and Ar the cutoff is experimentally higher than even that predicted by the YI model?~ Could this be a breakdown in the 1D approximation or some other issue?},

  abstract = {Watching plasmonic skyrmions Skyrmions are stable topological textures that arise from solutions of the electromagnetic field. Because these ``hedgehog''-like textures are robust, can be manipulated, and can interact, there is an interest in pursuing them for memory and logic applications. Skyrmions can also be generated in thin metal layers under optical excitation, but detailed information about the vectorial dynamics of these surface plasmon polariton skyrmions is so far lacking. Davis et al. used a time-resolved photoelectron vector microscope to image their spatiotemporal dynamics, piecing together movies as the skyrmions propagated across the surface of a perfect gold crystal. Access to dynamics with such high spatial and temporal resolution could help in controlling other nanophotonic systems. Science, this issue p. eaba6415 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONTopology is the study of geometric properties that are unaffected by continuous changes in shape and size. Skyrmions are examples of topological defects in vector fields. Skyrmions exhibit a characteristic vector structure. When excited by electromagnetic near fields on thin metal films, they are called plasmonic skyrmions. These fields exist at sub\textendash 100-nm scales and oscillate with periods of a few femtoseconds and thus are difficult to measure. RATIONALETwo-photon photoemission electron microscopy studies were previously able to image the local plasmon fields with femtosecond time resolution, but the vector information of the local electric fields was missing. Here we introduce a new technique, time-resolved vector microscopy, that enables us to compose entire movies on a subfemtosecond time scale and a 10-nm spatial scale of the electric field vectors of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). We use this technique to image complete time sequences of propagating surface plasmons, demonstrating their spin-momentum locking, as well as plasmonic skyrmions on atomically flat single-crystalline gold films that have been patterned using gold ion beam lithography. RESULTSThe key technique to obtain vector information is to take two sequences of the entire process with two different probe beam polarizations. Hence, the electric field vectors will be projected onto the probing electric field by the two-photon photoemission process. The spatial dependence of the two in-plane vector components coupled with Maxwell's equations then permits the retrieval of the out-of-plane component. This allows us to unambiguously resolve all vector components of the electric field as well as their time dynamics, enabling the retrieval of the experimental time-dependent skyrmion number and indicating the periodic transformation from skyrmion number +1 to -1 and back on a time scale of a few femtoseconds. Additionally, all three magnetic field vectors of the surface can be obtained from the electric field vectors by using Maxwell's curl equation. CONCLUSIONWith our vector microscopy technique, we are able to image plasmonic spin-momentum locking and plasmonic skyrmion dynamics. In the future, other topological nanophotonic systems should be in reach as well; these include plasmonic merons or short-range skyrmions, where the dispersion of plasmons in extremely thin films is used. This research will open the door to creating linear optical features on the few-nanometer length scale. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/368/6489/eaba6415/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Ultrafast time-resolved vector microscopy of plasmonic skyrmions.Femtosecond laser pump-probe techniques using polarized beams combined with two-photon electron emission in an electron microscope enables the retrieval of all vector components of the electric field of propagating SPPs as a function of time. We used this technique to image the vectorial time dynamics of the plasmonic skyrmion field. Hexagons are milled into single-crystalline gold flakes via ion beam lithography. A circularly polarized femtosecond laser pulse excites surface plasmon waves on the gold flakes that interfere to create an SPP skyrmion lattice. The SPPs are detected by interference with a second laser pulse that is first polarized in the x direction to retrieve the Ex component of the SPP wave and then is polarized in the y direction to produce the Ey component. These fields are combined to obtain the characteristic in-plane pattern of the skyrmion lattice: E{$\parallel$}E{$\parallel<$}mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"{$><$}mml:mrow{$><$}mml:msub{$><$}mml:mi{$>$}E{$<$}/mml:mi{$><$}mml:mo{$>\parallel<$}/mml:mo{$><$}/mml:msub{$><$}/mml:mrow{$><$}/mml:math{$>$}. Use of the measured field components in Maxwell's equations enables the vertical field component Ez to be calculated. From these data, we reconstruct the vector field of the SPP skyrmion and, by varying the laser pump-probe delay time ({$\Delta\tau$}), gain time-resolved information (top right), allowing us to create vector movies that show plasmonic spin-momentum locking and plasmonic skyrmions (bottom right). SEM, scanning electron microscopy; TR-PEEM, time-resolved photoemission electron microscopy. Plasmonic skyrmions are an optical manifestation of topological defects in a continuous vector field. Identifying them requires characterization of the vector structure of the electromagnetic near field on thin metal films. Here we introduce time-resolved vector microscopy that creates movies of the electric field vectors of surface plasmons with subfemtosecond time steps and a 10-nanometer spatial scale. We image complete time sequences of propagating surface plasmons as well as plasmonic skyrmions, resolving all vector components of the electric field and their time dynamics, thus demonstrating dynamic spin-momentum coupling as well as the time-varying skyrmion number. The ability to image linear optical effects in the spin and phase structures of light in the single-nanometer range will allow for entirely novel microscopy and metrology applications. An ultrafast electron microscope tracks the dynamics of plasmonic skyrmions with high spatiotemporal resolution.

Recently, Andreev entanglers that use two quantum dots as filters to adiabatically split and separate the quasi-particles of Cooper pairs have shown efficient splitting through measurements of the transport charge but the spin entanglement has not been directly confirmed. Here we report measurements on parallel quantum dot Josephson junction devices allowing a Josephson current to flow due to the adiabatic splitting and recombination of the Cooper pair between the dots. The evidence for this non-local transport is confirmed through study of the non-dissipative supercurrent while tuning independently the dots with local electrical gates. As the Josephson current arises only from processes that maintain the coherence, we can confirm that a current flows from the spatially separated entangled pair.},

  abstract = {Heterodyne detection of the stimulated photon echo (HSPE) is discussed and applied to explore molecular solvation dynamics. With this technique the in-phase and in-quadrature parts of the induced transient nonlinear polarization can be time-gated. A third-order perturbative description of the HSPE is presented, which shows that the transient polarization provides direct information on the real and imaginary components of the nonlinear optical response functions of the system. In the spectral diffusion limit and for impulsive excitation conditions, analytical expressions for the HSPE signal are derived and model calculations are presented. This novel technique is applied to a nonlinear optical study of the dye molecule DTTCI dissolved in ethylene glycol. Several effects are analyzed in detail as, for instance, the intriguing interference effect between the conventional and virtual echo contributions to the total HSPE signal. Furthermore, it is shown that from HSPE measurements the instantaneous frequency of the emitted (nonlinear polarization induced) signal can be derived and that its time-dependent shift projects directly onto the dynamical Stokes shift and the energy reorganization process of the coupled solute\textendash solvent complex. It will also be shown that the experimental data can be simulated using the multimode Brownian oscillator model.},

We describe a microfluidic single-cell assay that quantifies the oxygen saturation of individual RBCs in high throughput. Although single-RBC measurements of volume and mass are routinely performed in hospitals by hematology analyzers, measurements that characterize the primary function of RBCs, the delivery of oxygen, have not been made. With this system, we find measurable variation that is positively correlated with cellular hemoglobin concentration but independent of osmolarity. These results imply that the cytoplasmic environment of each cell is different and that these differences modulate the function that each cell performs., Oxygen is transported throughout the body by hemoglobin (Hb) in red blood cells (RBCs). Although the oxygen affinity of blood is well-understood and routinely assessed in patients by pulse oximetry, variability at the single-cell level has not been previously measured. In contrast, single-cell measurements of RBC volume and Hb concentration are taken millions of times per day by clinical hematology analyzers, and they are important factors in determining the health of the hematologic system. To better understand the variability and determinants of oxygen affinity on a cellular level, we have developed a system that quantifies the oxygen saturation, cell volume, and Hb concentration for individual RBCs in high throughput. We find that the variability in single-cell saturation peaks at an oxygen partial pressure of 2.9\%, which corresponds to the maximum slope of the oxygen\textendash Hb dissociation curve. In addition, single-cell oxygen affinity is positively correlated with Hb concentration but independent of osmolarity, which suggests variation in the Hb to 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2\textendash 3 DPG) ratio on a cellular level. By quantifying the functional behavior of a cellular population, our system adds a dimension to blood cell analysis and other measurements of single-cell variability.},

A unique advantage of the stabilized frequency comb is that it provides, in a single laser beam, about a million optical modes with very narrow linewidths4 and absolute frequency positions known to better than one part in 1015 (ref. 5). One important application of this vast array of highly coherent optical fields is precision spectroscopy, in which a large number of modes can be used to map internal atomic energy structure and dynamics6,7. However, an efficient means of simultaneously identifying, addressing and measuring the amplitude or relative phase of individual modes has not existed. Here we use a high-resolution disperser8,9 to separate the individual modes of a stabilized frequency comb into a two-dimensional array in the image plane of the spectrometer. We illustrate the power of this technique for high-resolution spectral fingerprinting of molecular iodine vapour, acquiring in a few milliseconds absorption images covering over 6 THz of bandwidth with high frequency resolution. Our technique for direct and parallel accessing of stabilized frequency comb modes could find application in high-bandwidth spread-spectrum communications with increased security, high-resolution coherent quantum control, and arbitrary optical waveform synthesis10 with control at the optical radian level.},

Now, Divitt et al. demonstrate that metasurfaces can also be operated as time-dependent active optical elements. They used an array of dielectric metasurfaces to demonstrate pulse shaping of ultrashort (femtosecond) pulses in the near-infrared by manipulating the phase and amplitude of the frequency components. The results present a path for the development of dynamic metasurfaces as a platform for miniaturized optical technology with advanced time-dependent functionality. Science, this issue p. 890 Advances in ultrafast lasers, chirped pulse amplifiers, and frequency comb technology require fundamentally new pulse-modulation strategies capable of supporting unprecedentedly large bandwidth and high peak power while maintaining high spectral resolution. We demonstrate how dielectric metasurfaces can be leveraged to shape the temporal profile of a near-infrared femtosecond pulse. Finely tailored pulse-shaping operations, including splitting, compression, chirping, and higher-order distortion, are achieved using a Fourier-transform setup embedding metasurfaces able to manipulate, simultaneously and independently, the amplitude and phase of the constituent frequency components of the pulse. Exploiting metasurfaces to manipulate the temporal characteristics of light expands their impact and opens new vistas in the field of ultrafast science and technology. Metasurfaces can arbitrarily shape an ultrafast optical pulse by spectrally manipulating the amplitude and phase.

The amount of the charge emitted from the surface gives a clear indication of phase sensitivity, as predicted by our simulations and also by a simple intuitive model. This phenomenon was used to determine the CE phase value of each laser pulse in a mode-locked, unamplified, low-energy pulse train. The inability of the commonly used f -to-2 f interferometric method to measure accurately extracavity drifts of the CE phase is discussed and contrasted with the direct phase measurement method proposed here. The evolution of the CE phase upon propagation of pulses comparable in duration to the optical cycle is analysed.},

In this work, the optimization of the total electron yield of ultrafast photon-triggered field emission cathodes composed of arrays of nanosharp, high-aspect-ratio, single-crystal silicon pillars is explored through the variation of the emitter pitch and height. Arrays of 6 nm tip radius silicon emitters with emitter densities between 1.2 and 73.9 million tips cm-2 (hexagonally packed arrays with emitter pitch between 1.25 and 10 {$\mu$}m) and emitter height between 2.0 and 8.5 {$\mu$}m were characterized using 35 fs 800 nm laser pulses. Three-photon electron emission for low-energy ({$<$}0.3 {$\mu$}J) light pulses and strong-field emission for high-energy ({$>$}1 {$\mu$}J) light pulses was observed, in agreement with the literature. Of the devices tested, the arrays with emitter pitch equal to 2.5 {$\mu$}m produced the highest total electron yield; arrays with larger emitter pitch suffer area sub-utilization, and in devices with smaller emitter pitch the larger emitter density does not compensate the smaller per-emitter current due to the electric field shadowing that results from the proximity of the adjacent tips. Experimental data and simulations suggest that 2 {$\mu$}m tall emitters achieve practical optimal performance as shorter emitters have visibly smaller field factors due to the proximity of the emitter tip to the substrate, and taller emitters show marginal improvement in the electron yield at the expense of greater fabrication difficulty.},

Furthermore, the possibility exists for combining spectroscopic characterization or identification with imaging because the radiation is broadband in nature. To achieve this, we require novel methods for real-time analysis of THz waveforms. This paper describes a robust algorithm for extracting material parameters from measured THz waveforms. Our algorithm simultaneously obtains both the thickness and the complex refractive index of an unknown sample under certain conditions. In contrast, most spectroscopic transmission measurements require knowledge of the sample's thickness for an accurate determination of its optical parameters. Our approach relies on a model-based estimation, a gradient descent search, and the total variation measure. We explore the limits of this technique and compare the results with literature data for optical parameters of several different materials.},

The bandwidth of the XUV light emitted by these sources reflects the XUV generation process used. Whereas light from soft-X-ray lasers1 and seeded XUV FELs2 typically has a relatively narrow bandwidth, plasma sources and HHG sources often emit broadband XUV pulses3. Since these characteristic properties of a given source impose limitations on applications, techniques enabling modification of the bandwidth are highly desirable. Here we introduce a concept for efficient spectral compression by four-wave mixing (FWM), exploiting a phase-matching scheme based on closely-spaced resonances. We demonstrate the compression of broadband radiation in the 145\textendash 130\,nm wavelength range into a narrow-bandwidth XUV pulse at 100.3\,nm wavelength in the presence of a broadband near-infrared (NIR) pulse in a krypton gas jet.

The original 3D image can then be reconstructed as a linear combination of these well-behaved functions, which have a Gaussian-like shape, with the same expansion coefficients as the projection. In the process of finding the expansion coefficients, regularization is used to achieve a more reliable reconstruction of noisy projections. The method is efficient and computationally cheap and is particularly well suited for transforming projections obtained in photoion and photoelectron imaging experiments. It can be used for any image with cylindrical symmetry, requires minimal user's input, and provides a reliable reconstruction in certain cases when the commonly used Fourier\textendash Hankel Abel transform method fails.},

  abstract = {The process of a local excitation evolving into an intramolecular charge-separated state is followed and compared for several systems by directly simulating the time propagation of the electronic wavefunction. The wavefunction and Hamiltonian are handled using the extended second-order algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC(2)-x), which explicitly accounts for electron correlation in the dynamic many-particle state. The details of the charge separation can be manipulated according to the chemical composition of the system; atoms which dope the conjugated system with either particles or holes are shown to effect whether the particle or hole is more mobile. Initially, the charges oscillate between the ends of linear molecules (with different rates), separating periodically, but, at long times, both charges tend to spread over the whole molecule. Charge separation is also shown to occur for asymmetric systems, where it may eventually be experimentally feasible to excite a localized resonance (nonstationary state) on one end of the molecule preferentially and follow the ensuing dynamics.},

During this transfer process, the graphene invariably becomes contaminated with foreign materials. This contamination proves to be very problematic in the (S)TEM because often\,{$>$}95\% of the graphene is obscured, and imaging of the pristine areas results in e-beam-induced hydrocarbon deposition which further acts to obscure the desired imaging area. In this article, the authors examine two cleaning techniques for CVD grown graphene that mitigate both aspects of the contamination problem: visible contamination covering the graphene, and ``invisible'' contamination that deposits onto the graphene under e-beam irradiation. The visible contamination may be removed quickly by a rapid thermal annealing to 1200\,\textdegree C in situ and the invisible e-beam-deposited contamination may be removed through an Ar/O2 annealing procedure prior to imaging in the (S)TEM.},

This is typical for electrons in atoms, molecules or solids exposed to strong circularly polarized laser pulses (4,5). Here we measure how the transmission probability through a rotating tunnel depends on the sign of the magnetic quantum number m of the electron and thus on the initial sense of rotation of its quantum phase. We further show that the electron keeps part of that rotary motion on its way through the tunnel by measuring m-dependent modification of the electron emission pattern. These findings are relevant for attosecond metrology as well as for interpretation of strong field electron emission from atoms and molecules (6-13) and directly demonstrates the creation of ring currents in bound states of ions with attosecond precision. In solids, this could open a way to inducing and controlling ring-current related topological phenomena (14).},

But although pulses of subfemtosecond duration are available, so far the energy of these pulses is too low to fully implement the traditional pump\textendash probe technique. Here, we demonstrate `attosecond angular streaking', an alternative approach to achieving attosecond time resolution. The method uses the rotating electric-field vector of an intense circularly polarized pulse to deflect photo-ionized electrons in the radial spatial direction; the instant of ionization is then mapped to the final angle of the momentum vector in the polarization plane. We resolved subcycle dynamics in tunnelling ionization by the streaking field alone and demonstrate a temporal localization accuracy of 24 as r.m.s. and an estimated resolution of {$\approx$}200 as. The demonstrated accuracy should enable the study of one of the fundamental aspects of quantum physics: the process of tunnelling of an electron through an energetically forbidden region.},

Particle-in-cell simulations suggest that attosecond pulse intensity may be increased by up to four orders of magnitude in a multipass system, with decreased duration of the attosecond pulse train.

Here we reduce the thickness of the protective hafnium oxynitride layer at the surface of a silicon solar cell to just eight angstroms, using electric-field-effect passivation to enable the efficient energy transfer of the triplet excitons formed in the tetracene. The maximum~combined yield of the fission in tetracene and the energy transfer to silicon is around 133 per cent, establishing the potential of singlet exciton fission to increase the~efficiencies of silicon solar cells and reduce the cost of the energy that~they generate.},

  title = {Theoretical and {{Practical Considerations}} for {{Nano-Structured Graphene-Based Transistors}}},
  author = {Emadi, Ramin and Firouzeh, Zaker Hossein and Safian, Reza and Nezhad, Abolghasem Zeidaabadi},
  note = {\section{Review}

\par
In this work, entitled "Theoretical and Practical Considerations for Nano-Structured Graphene-Based Transistors" the authors present a study of the switching speed and "practical considerations" for calculations of C-V curves and scattering parameters when creating transistors using graphene channels and "nanostructured" features.
\par
In general, I find that the paper's messaging and content does not formulate into a compelling manuscript warranting publication in JSTQE.~ I provide several justifications for this conclusion below.
\par
First of all, the term "nanostructuring" to me implies nanoscale geometric structures are used in some way to enhance the performance of the device. However, in this work this term is used simply to denote \textasciitilde 10 nm layer thicknesses. I think there should be a clearer adjective, such as nanometer-scale layers, rather than nano-structured.~ 
\par
Second, very similar devices have been studied in detail in the past decade.~ There have been multiple experimental demonstrations of switching speeds in excess of 10 GHz using top-gated graphene-based transistors with near identical structure to what is presented in this manuscript (Ref. 1 and 2).~ The key aspects in the submitted manuscript that seem to be different in some way are the used of poly-si gate/contact materials (as opposed to metals such as Au) and a very thin SiO2 layer (on the order of 10 nm).~ However, these changes are not strongly motivated in the mansucript to my opinion, and the results are not well compared to current device geometries and materials to give the reader context for comparing the presented results.~
\par
While one could argue that there is room for simulating poly-Si gates and thin dielectrics, I feel on this front the manuscript falls short of providing necessary insight for device designers.~ The original simulation setup in the submitted manuscript seems to completely disregard the top-gate influence.~ Top-gates are used in all high-speed devices, some already with very thin top-gate dielectrics (on the order of 30 nm in Ref. 2 below), achieving greater than 10 GHz cut-off frequencies in experiment.~ While the top-gate is shown in the drawing of a transistor device in Fig. 7,~ I see no clear mention of the Al203 and top gate until the very end of the mansucript.~ Are the Al2O3 and top-gate material properties and voltage conditions incorporated in the cut-off frequency calculation? Despite the top-gate getting relatively little attention, the calculations are for a very specific design case making the paper have a very narrow scope for a specific set of parameters and device materials. ~~
\par
Finally, at the end it is stated that the carrier mobility in graphene is highly important to device operating speed, but the device mobility chosen was not referenced directly.~ Is there an experimental justification of the chosen value?~ Was it taken directly from a reference?~ How does the cuto-off frequency scale with mobility?~ With channel length?~ Should the top-gate material impact this mobility?~ Furthermore, channel length is clearly an important parameter in experimental results (see Ref. 2), but seems to be not strongly considered here in the presented calculations and simulation results.~
\par
Overall, given the points above and open questions that remain, I feel that I cannot recommend publication of the manuscript in its present form to JSTQE. Perhaps with greater detail, justification of chosen materials and simulation paramters, improved presentation for widening the scope of the results such that they provide greater insight to experimentalists, and direct comparison to current state of the art results, a revised version of this study could be suitable for publication in the future.~

The study reveals electronic quantum beats characteristic of wavelike energy motion within the bacteriochlorophyll complex from the green sulphur bacterium Chlorobium tepidum.

Whereas the more common application of grid electrodes leads to transmission reduction, severe trajectory deflections and blurring due to the non-point source geometry, these problems are avoided with open lens electrodes.

Nanofocusing of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) propagating along the shaft of a conical gold taper is used to create a spatially isolated, spectrally broad nanoscale light source at its very apex. The interference between these incident SPPs and SPPs that are backpropagating from the apex leads to the formation of an inherently phase-stable interferogram, which we detect in the far field by partially scattering SPPs off a small protrusion on the taper shaft. We show that these interferograms allow the reconstruction of both the amplitude and phase of the local optical near fields around individual nanoparticles optically coupled to the taper apex. We extract local light scattering spectra of particles and quantify line broadenings and spectral shifts induced by tip-sample coupling. Our experimental findings are supported by corresponding finite-difference time-domain and coupled dipole simulations and show that, in the limit of weak tip-sample coupling, the measurements directly probe the projected local density of optical states of the plasmonic system. The combination of a highly stable inline interferometer with the inherent optical background suppression through nanofocusing makes it a promising tool for the locally resolved study of the spectral and temporal optical response of coupled hybrid nanosystems.},

A more recently developed split element, wide field filter requires only half as many polarizers as the earlier types, which may be an advantage for some applications.Various methods of adjusting the transmission bands of a birefringent filter, including the use of elements of variable thickness, and phase shifters are discussed. For most purposes the electro-optical phase shifters are probably the most promising. For special purposes, such as spectrophotometry, phase shifters composed of rotating fractional wave plates may be more advantageous. Two such phase shifters and their application in simple and split element filters are described.A few crystalline materials which have been used or might be used to advantage in birefringent filters are mentioned.Finally, the possibility of using polarizing interferometers in combination with birefringent elements for filters with extremely sharp transmission bands (in the range of hundredths or thousandths of an angstrom) is very briefly discussed.},

The transmitter operation is based on the repetitive, subpicosecond laser excitation of a Hertzian dipole antenna embedded in a charged coplanar line. With this transmitter electromagnetic beams of 1/2 cycle THz pulses at a repetition rate of 100 MHz are produced. The associated optoelectronic receiver is gated in synchronism with the excitation of the transmitter by subpicosecond pulses from the same laser source. With this receiver, the 10-nW beams of THz pulses were observed with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 10000:1.

The charge distribution is introduced to the time-domain method based on a modified Fowler-Nordheim field emission model, which accounts for the band-bending of the charge carriers at the emitter surface. This algorithm is capable of considering various effects in the emission process such as space-charge, Coulomb blockade and image charge.

The DGTD algorithm is a three-dimensional, dual-field and fully explicit method for efficiently solving Maxwell equations in the time domain on unstructured grids. On the other hand, the PIC algorithm is a versatile technique for the simulation of charged particles in an electromagnetic field. This paper introduces a novel strategy for combining both methods to solve for the electron motion and field distribution when an optical beam interacts with an electron bunch in a very general geometry. The developed software offers a complete and stable numerical solution of the problem for arbitrary charge and field distributions in the time domain on unstructured grids. For this purpose, an advanced search algorithm is developed for fast calculation of field data at charge points and for later importing to the PIC simulations. In addition, we propose a field-based coupling between the two methods resulting in a stable and precise time marching scheme for both fields and charged particle motion. To benchmark the solver, some examples are numerically solved and compared with analytical solutions. Eventually, the developed software is utilized to simulate the field emission from a flat metal plate and a silicon nano-tip. In the future, we will use this technique for the simulation and design of ultrafast compact x-ray sources.},

  abstract = {Free Electron Lasers (FELs) are a solution for providing intense, coherent and bright radiation in the hard X-ray regime. Due to the low wall-plug efficiency of FEL facilities, it is crucial and additionally very useful to develop complete and accurate simulation tools for better optimizing a FEL interaction. The highly sophisticated dynamics involved in a FEL process was the main obstacle hindering the development of general simulation tools for this problem. We present a numerical algorithm based on finite difference time domain/Particle in cell (FDTD/PIC) in a Lorentz boosted coordinate system which is able to fulfill a full-wave simulation of a FEL process. The developed software offers a suitable tool for the analysis of FEL interactions without considering any of the usual approximations. A coordinate transformation to bunch rest frame makes the very different length scales of bunch size, optical wavelengths and the undulator period transform to values with the same order. Consequently, FDTD/PIC simulations in conjunction with efficient parallelization techniques make the full-wave simulation feasible using the available computational resources. Several examples of free electron lasers are analyzed using the developed software, the results are benchmarked based on standard FEL codes and discussed in detail. Program summary Program Title: MITHRA Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/9f5k4zbtkg.1 Licensing provisions: GNU General Public License 3 Programming language: C++ Nature of problem: Full-wave simulation of the free electron laser radiation is accomplished by the code. MITHRA transforms the particle positions and momenta to the bunch rest frame using the Lorentz transformation. Electrons entering the undulator start radiating due to the induced wiggling motion. The back-effect of the radiation on the bunch results in the modulation of the electron position, which in turn generates a coherent radiation. This process as the main principle behind the operation of free electron lasers is simulated using Maxwell equations, electron motion equations and relativity principles. Solution method: Non-standard Finite Difference Time Domain (NSFDTD) combined with Particle-in-Cell (PIC) is implemented in the Lorentz-boosted framework to calculate the FEL radiation. Parallelization is done using both multi-threading (open-MP) and message passing interface (MPI) to maximize the computation efficiency.},

The growth mechanism of the pillars is studied in detail and is proposed to be a combination of vapor-liquid-solid and vapor-solid models. The piezoelectric and optical properties of single pillars are characterized using piezoresponse force microscopy and micro-photoluminescence spectroscopy, respectively. The pillars show strong excitonic emissions up to room temperature, which indicate a relatively low defect density and good crystalline quality. The obtained piezoelectric coefficient d33 is (7.5{$\pm$}0.6)~pm~V-1, which is to our knowledge the first reported value for a single nanopillar.}

  abstract = {Coherent manipulation of quantum systems with light is expected to be a cornerstone of future information and communication technology, including quantum computation and cryptography1. The transfer of an optical phase onto a quantum wavefunction is a defining aspect of coherent interactions and forms the basis of quantum state preparation, synchronization and metrology. Light-phase-modulated electron states near atoms and molecules are essential for the techniques of attosecond science, including the generation of extreme-ultraviolet pulses and orbital tomography2,3. In contrast, the quantum-coherent phase-modulation of energetic free-electron beams has not been demonstrated, although it promises direct access to ultrafast imaging and spectroscopy with tailored electron pulses on the attosecond scale. Here we demonstrate the coherent quantum state manipulation of free-electron populations in an electron microscope beam. We employ the interaction of ultrashort electron pulses with optical near-fields4,5,6,7,8,9 to induce Rabi oscillations in the populations of electron momentum states, observed as a function of the optical driving field. Excellent agreement with the scaling of an equal-Rabi multilevel quantum ladder is obtained10, representing the observation of a light-driven `quantum walk'5 coherently reshaping electron density in momentum space11. We note that, after the interaction, the optically generated superposition of momentum states evolves into a train of attosecond electron pulses. Our results reveal the potential of quantum control for the precision structuring of electron densities, with possible applications ranging from ultrafast electron spectroscopy and microscopy to accelerator science and free-electron lasers.},

In order to place current fNIRS research in its proper context, this paper presents a brief historical overview of the events that have shaped the present status of fNIRS. In particular, technological progresses of fNIRS are highlighted (i.e. from single-site to multi-site functional cortical measurements (images)), introduction of the commercial multi-channel systems, recent commercial wireless instrumentation and more advanced prototypes.},

@article{FieldElectronEmission2016,
  title = {Field Electron Emission},
  year = {2016},
  month = oct,
  journal = {Wikipedia},
  abstract = {Field electron emission (also known as field emission (FE) and electron field emission) is emission of electrons induced by an electrostatic field. The most common context is field emission from a solid surface into vacuum. However, field emission can take place from solid or liquid surfaces, into vacuum, air, a fluid, or any non-conducting or weakly conducting dielectric. The field-induced promotion of electrons from the valence to conduction band of semiconductors (the Zener effect) can also be regarded as a form of field emission. The terminology is historical because related phenomena of surface photoeffect, thermionic emission (or Richardson\textendash Dushman effect) and "cold electronic emission", i.e. the emission of electrons in strong static (or quasi-static) electric fields, were discovered and studied independently from the 1880s to 1930s. When field emission is used without qualifiers it typically means "cold emission". Field emission in pure metals occurs in high electric fields: the gradients are typically higher than 1 gigavolt per metre and strongly dependent upon the work function. While electron sources based on field emission have a number of applications, field emission is most commonly an undesirable primary source of vacuum breakdown and electrical discharge phenomena, which engineers work to prevent. Examples of applications for surface field emission include construction of bright electron sources for high-resolution electron microscopes or the discharge of induced charges from spacecraft. Devices which eliminate induced charges are termed charge-neutralizers. Field emission was explained by quantum tunneling of electrons in the late 1920s. This was one of the triumphs of the nascent quantum mechanics. The theory of field emission from bulk metals was proposed by Ralph H. Fowler and Lothar Wolfgang Nordheim. A family of approximate equations, "Fowler\textendash Nordheim equations", is named after them. Strictly, Fowler\textendash Nordheim equations apply only to field emission from bulk metals and (with suitable modification) to other bulk crystalline solids, but they are often used \textendash{} as a rough approximation \textendash{} to describe field emission from other materials. In some respects, field electron emission is a paradigm example of what physicists mean by tunneling. Unfortunately, it is also a paradigm example of the intense mathematical difficulties that can arise. Simple solvable models of the tunneling barrier lead to equations (including the original 1928 Fowler\textendash Nordheim-type equation) that get predictions of emission current density too low by a factor of 100 or more. If one inserts a more realistic barrier model into the simplest form of the Schr\"odinger equation, then an awkward mathematical problem arises over the resulting differential equation: it is known to be mathematically impossible in principle to solve this equation exactly in terms of the usual functions of mathematical physics, or in any simple way. To get even an approximate solution, it is necessary to use special approximate methods known in physics as "semi-classical" or "quasi-classical" methods. Worse, a mathematical error was made in the original application of these methods to field emission, and even the corrected theory that was put in place in the 1950s has been formally incomplete until very recently. A consequence of these (and other) difficulties has been a heritage of misunderstanding and disinformation that still persists in some current field emission research literature. This article tries to present a basic account of field emission "for the 21st century and beyond" that is free from these confusions.},

  abstract = {To estimate the apex field-enhancement factor {$\gamma$}aassociated with a pointed protrusion on a flat planar surface, the simple physical models of a `floating sphere at emitter-plane potential' and a `hemisphere on a post' are often discussed. The corresponding mathematical expressions have the form: {$\gamma$}a=m+h/{$\rho$}, where {$\rho$} is the sphere or hemisphere radius, h is its `height above the emitter plane', and m is a constant variously taken as 0, 2 or 3. Recent numerical simulations for the `hemisphere on a post' model, reported elsewhere by two of us (CJE and GV) and by Kokkaris, Modinos and Xanthakis, have shown that all of these simple formulae significantly overpredict {$\gamma$}a if h/{$\rho$} is large. This article first reexamines the basis of these simple formulae and confirms that they are less secure than is sometimes thought. The formulae reported elsewhere as fits to the numerical results are then quoted and compared with the simple formulae, and with the known exact analytical result for the `hemi-ellipsoid on a plane' model. Discrepancies can be rationalised. Some general conclusions are drawn.},

  abstract = {The scaled barrier field f is defined as the local field F that determines a field emission tunneling barrier, divided by the critical field needed to reduce to zero a barrier initially of height (for F = 0) equal to the local work-function. The description of field emission current-voltage (I-V) characteristics is more universal, and closer to theory, if measured voltages are reassigned as f-values. This paper describes a simple method for directly converting voltage to f-value, using the slope of a Fowler-Nordheim plot of type ln\{I/V2\} vs 1/V. A short table of characteristic f-values could be helpful for describing typical emission features such as the emission onset, the onset of emitter degradation, or the onset of space-charge effects. For an old-style metal field emitter of moderate to large apex radius, a table based on the systematic work of  Dyke and Trolan [Phys. Rev. 89, 799 (1953) ] is given. Tables of this kind, if prepared for different categories of field emitter, could be helpful in emitter comparisons. In another use, different individual emitters in emitter arrays can be thought of as operating at different f-values. The use of f-values seems a simple, additional helpful way of describing field emitter behavior, particularly in technological contexts.},

The sensitivity of conventional oscilloscopes is limited by the electronic bandwidth of photodetectors and circuits. Now Foster et al. demonstrate an all-optical method for real-time measurement of temporal optical waveforms with a resolution a hundredfold higher than electronic techniques. The heart of the device is a silicon photonic chip made with the same materials and techniques as standard microprocessors but which manipulates photons instead of electrons. The potential integration of this device in microelectronics could produce an instrument that could be used in many branches of science where simple measurements of optical waveforms are required.},

  abstract = {1. Introduction.\textemdash The main features of the phenomenon of the extraction of electrons from cold metals by intense electric fields are well known, and an approximate theory of the effect was first developed by Schottky. More recently the experimental data have been much improved, notably by Millikan and Eyring, and Millikan and Lauritsen. The theory has been considered afresh by O. W. Richardson and by Houston working with Sommerfeld. It seems to us, however, that there is still room for improvement in the theoretical exposition and its correlation with the experiments. Neither O. W. Richardson nor Houston really treat the theory in the simple straightforward way which is now possible in the new mechanics, using the revived electron theory of metals which we owe to Sommerfeld. Again, while Millikan and Lauritsen seem to have established quite definitely the laws of dependence of the emission on the field strength F, they speak of the implications of their result in a way which is hard to justify and might in certain circumstances prove to be definitely misleading. Millikan and Lauritsen show that a plot of log I, where I is the current, against 1/F yields a good straight line whenever the experimental conditions are sufficiently stable. At ordinary temperatures these currents are completely independent of the temperature. The formula for these current is I = Ce-a/F, (1) Which is, of course, indistinguishable from I = CF2e-a/F. (2) Millikan and his associates have also shown that as the higher temperatures, at which ordinary thermionic emission begins, are approached, the strong field emission does become sensitive to temperature and finally blends into the thermionic.},

First, by studying the exact dynamics of harmonic systems in the presence of an arbitrary radiation field, it is demonstrated that anharmonicities in the system's potential are a necessary requirement for phase controllability. Then, by analysing the space-time symmetries of the laser-driven Liouville dynamics for classical and quantum systems, a common set of temporal symmetries for the driving field that need to be violated to induce transport is identified. The conditions apply to continuous wave lasers and to symmetry breaking effects that do not rely on the control of the absolute phase of the field. Known examples of laser fields that can induce transport in symmetric systems are seen to be particular cases of these symmetry constraints.},

The original experiments investigating ATI used relatively long laser pulses, with the result that amplitudes, energy widths and angular distributions of the individual photoelectron peaks depended on the laser intensity. In addition, the widths of the peaks, as well as their absolute energy positions, changed according to the temporal width of the laser pulse. These dependencies were not intrinsic to the ionization process, but rather were all eventually ascribed to ponderomotive forces exerted on free photoelectrons by the laser focus.

Starting from a general quantum-electrodynamic model, both quantum and classical effects and operating regimes of these radiation devices are described. The article provides a unified physical description of the interaction kinematics, and presents equations for the characterization of spontaneous and stimulated radiative emission in these various effects and devices. Universal relations between the spontaneous and stimulated emission parameters are revealed and shown to be related (in the quantum limit) to Einstein relations for atomic radiators and (in the classical limit) to the relations derived by Madey for magnetic bremsstrahlung FEL for on-axis radiative emission. Examples for the application of the formulation are given, estimating the feasibility of channeling radiation x-ray laser and optical regime Smith-Purcell FEL, and deriving the gain equations of magnetic bremsstrahlung FEL and CRM for arbitrary electron propagation direction, structure (wiggler) axis, and radiative emission angle.},

Here we report the observation of one of the most fundamental nonlinear X-ray\textendash matter interactions: the concerted nonlinear Compton scattering of two identical hard X-ray photons producing a single higher-energy photon.~The X-ray intensity reached 4 \texttimes{} 1020\,W\,cm-2, corresponding to an electric field well above the atomic unit of strength and within almost four orders of magnitude of the quantum-electrodynamic critical field. We measure a signal from solid beryllium that scales quadratically in intensity, consistent with simultaneous non-resonant two-photon scattering from nearly-free electrons. The high-energy photons show an anomalously large redshift that is incompatible with a free-electron approximation for the ground-state electron distribution, suggesting an enhanced nonlinearity for scattering at large momentum transfer.},

  abstract = {A non-invasive, unstaining tissue measurement method is expected to be an important tool for regenerative medical. As THz wave do not affect biological tissue because of their low energy, THz measurement method is expected to become a new modality of biomedical analysis as a noninvasive diagnosis. Due to the fact that biological tissues possess high level of hydration, it results in strong absorption at terahertz frequencies. A ridge waveguide LiNbO\textsubscript{3} based nonlinear terahertz generator was used to achieve high output power for THz time domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS). A ridge waveguide was designed for high efficiency emission from the LiNbO\textsubscript{3} crystal by the electro-optic Cherenkov effect. This THz-TDS system has realized six orders of dynamic range, and the bandwidth of the spectrum reaches 7 THz in the upper limit. We measured a reflected terahertz pulse shape at the interface between a plastic culture dish and biological tissues. By studying the gradient of phase spectroscopy of reflected THz pulse, we have been able to differentiate between human fibroblast tissue and cancer tissue. We demonstrate the application of terahertz time domain spectroscopy pulse in reflection geometry for the non-distractive measurement of biological tissues cultured on a plastic culture dish. These results demonstrate the potential of terahertz phase information for the study of biological tissues.},

The method is analogous to a sampling scope, with the electric field of the source measured by electro\textendash optic sampling using the light pulses from a femtosecond laser as a probe. The highest optical frequency that can be measured with our 'sampling scope' is determined by the pulse length of the femtosecond laser.

For a laterally bent n-type ZnO nanowire, with the stretched side exhibiting positive piezoelectric potential and the compressed side negative piezoelectric potential, the conduction band electrons tend to accumulate at the positive side. The positive side is thus partially screened by free charge carriers while the negative side of the piezoelectric potential preserves as long as the donor concentration is not too high. For a typical ZnO nanowire with diameter 50 nm, length 600 nm, donor concentration ND = 1 \texttimes{} 1017 cm-3 under a bending force of 80 nN, the potential in the positive side is {$<$}0.05 V and is approximately -0.3 V at the negative side. The theoretical results support the mechanism proposed for a piezoelectric nanogenerator. Degeneracy in the positive side of the nanowire is significant, but the temperature dependence of the potential profile is weak for the temperature range of 100-400 K.}

Recently, advances in coherent short-wavelength light sources, coupled with progress in algorithm development, have significantly enhanced the power of X-ray imaging. However, so far, high-fidelity diffraction imaging of periodic objects has been a challenge because the scattered light is concentrated in isolated peaks. Here, we use tabletop 13.5\hspace{0.25em}nm high-harmonic beams to make two significant advances. First, we demonstrate high-quality imaging of an extended, nearly periodic sample for the first time. Second, we achieve subwavelength spatial resolution (12.6\hspace{0.25em}nm) imaging at short wavelengths, also for the first time. The key to both advances is a novel technique called `modulus enforced probe', which enables robust and quantitative reconstructions of periodic objects.

The use of light fields to drive electrons promises access to vastly higher frequencies than conventionally used, as electric currents can be induced and manipulated on timescales faster than that of the quantum dephasing of charge carriers in solids. This forms the basis of terahertz (1012 hertz) electronics in artificial superlattices, and has enabled light-based switches and sampling of currents extending in frequency up to a few hundred terahertz. Here we demonstrate the extension of electronic metrology to the multi-petahertz (1015 hertz) frequency range. We use single-cycle intense optical fields (about one volt per \aa ngstr\"om) to drive electron motion in the bulk of silicon dioxide, and then probe its dynamics by using attosecond (10-18 seconds) streaking to map the time structure of emerging isolated attosecond extreme ultraviolet transients and their optical driver. The data establish a firm link between the emission of the extreme ultraviolet radiation and the light-induced intraband, phase-coherent electric currents that extend in frequency up to about eight petahertz, and enable access to the dynamic nonlinear conductivity of silicon dioxide. Direct probing, confinement and control of the waveform of intraband currents inside solids on attosecond timescales establish a method of realizing multi-petahertz coherent electronics. We expect this technique to enable new ways of exploring the interplay between electron dynamics and the structure of condensed matter on the atomic scale.},

Such beams are exploited to provide superresolution in microscopy. Creating extreme ultraviolet or soft-x-ray beams with controllable orbital angular momentum is a critical step towards extending superresolution to much higher spatial resolution. We show that orbital angular momentum is conserved during high-harmonic generation. Experimentally, we use a fundamental beam with |{$\mathscr{l}$}|=1 and interferometrically determine that the harmonics each have orbital angular momentum equal to their harmonic number. Theoretically, we show how any small value of orbital angular momentum can be coupled to any harmonic in a controlled manner. Our results open a route to microscopy on the molecular, or even submolecular, scale.},

  abstract = {Attosecond metrology has so far largely remained limited to titanium:sapphire lasers combined with an active stabilization of the carrier-envelope phase (CEP). These sources limit the achievable photon energy to \&\#x0223C;100 eV which is too low to access X-ray absorption edges of most second- and third-row elements which are central to chemistry, biology and material science. Therefore, intense efforts are underway to extend attosecond metrology to the soft-X-ray (SXR) domain using mid-infrared (mid-IR) drivers. Here, we introduce and experimentally demonstrate a method that solves the long-standing problem of the complete temporal characterization of ultra-broadband (\&\#x0226B;10 eV) attosecond pulses. We generalize the recently proposed Volkov-transform generalized projection algorithm (VTGPA) to the case of multiple overlapping photoelectron spectra and demonstrate its application to isolated attosecond pulses. This new approach overcomes all key limitations of previous attosecond-pulse reconstruction methods, in particular the central-momentum approximation (CMA), and it incorporates the physical, complex-valued and energy-dependent photoionization matrix elements. These properties make our approach general and particularly suitable for attosecond supercontinua of arbitrary bandwidth. We apply this method to attosecond SXR pulses generated from a two-cycle mid-IR driver, covering a bandwidth of \&\#x0223C;100 eV and reaching photon energies up to 180 eV. We extract an SXR pulse duration of (43\&\#x000B1;1) as from our streaking measurements, defining a new world record. Our results prove that the popular and broadly available scheme of post-compressing the output of white-light-seeded optical parametric amplifiers is adequate to produce high-contrast isolated attosecond pulses covering the L-edges of silicon, phosphorous and sulfur. Our new reconstruction method and experimental results open the path to the production and characterization of attosecond pulses lasting less than one atomic unit of time (24 as) and covering X-ray absorption edges of most light elements.},

@phdthesis{gehringSimulationTunnelingSemiconductor,
  title = {Simulation of {{Tunneling}} in {{Semiconductor Devices}}},
  author = {Gehring, Andreas},
  abstract = {MICROELECTRONICS has reached a point where quantum effects have a major impact on the electrical characteristics of semiconductor devices. One of the most important effects in this regime is the quantum-mechanical tunneling of carriers through thin dielectric layers. On the one hand, this leads to increased power consumption and thus limits the thickness of the gate dielectric. On the other hand, tunneling effects are used in non-volatile memory devices to transfer charge to an isolated floating gate. The tunneling current is caused by the transition of carriers from one electrode through a classically isolating region to another electrode. Three major factors influence this process: the carrier energy distribution at both electrodes, the quantum-mechanical transmission coefficient of the energy barrier between the electrodes, and the presence of traps in the insulating layer which may assist in the tunneling process. The carrier energy distribution is of major importance for the tunneling process. The FERMI-DIRAC or MAXWELL-BOLTZMANN distribution is frequently used to approximate this distribution. These expressions are, however, only valid near equilibrium and fail to describe the distribution of hot carriers. In this work an alternative expression for the distribution function, which is based on the carrier concentration, temperature, and kurtosis, was applied. This distribution shows good agreement with results from simulations and accurately reproduces the high-energy tail of the distribution. The heated MAXWELLian distribution, which only accounts for the electron concentration and temperature, completely fails to reproduce the high-energy tail and highly overestimates the tunneling current density. The quantum-mechanical transmission coefficient is calculated by solving the stationary SCHR\"ODINGER equation in the region considered for tunneling. The coefficient depends on the shape of the energy barrier in the dielectric layer. Dielectrics which consist of a single layer give rise to a linear potential variation in the barrier, yielding either a trapezoidal or a triangular band diagram. Analytical models can be derived to approximately calculate the transmission coefficient in these cases, based on the WENTZEL-KRAMERS-BRILLOUIN approximation or on GUNDLACH's formula. With reduced device dimensions, however, the gate dielectric in MOS devices must be scaled accordingly which, for the commonly used material SiO, leads to an intolerably high gate current density. To overcome this problem, gate dielectric stacks including high- dielectrics have been proposed. In such dielectric stacks the band profile has a non-linear shape, and models based on triangular or trapezoidal barriers are no more valid. Instead, SCHR\"ODINGER's equation must be solved using the transfer-matrix or the quantum transmitting boundary method. These methods have been studied and the quantum transmitting boundary method was found superior due to its better numerical stability and the possibility to apply it to two- and three-dimensional problems. Non-volatile memory devices need to endure up to  write and erase cycles at a voltage of 8-12V. This repeated high-field stress introduces defects in the tunneling dielectric, which give rise to trap-assisted tunneling current at low electric fields. That trap generation is considered a major reason for device degradation. In this work trap-assisted tunneling is modeled as a two-step process during which energy relaxation by phonon emission takes place. The trap occupancy in the dielectric is described by a time-dependent rate equation. To solve this equation, an iterative procedure is applied. Models to describe the outlined processes have been implemented into the general-purpose device simulator MINIMOS-NT. Several applications are investigated, where a distinction between MOS transistors and non-volatile memory devices is made. The applicability of alternative dielectric materials is investigated and, as an example, a MOS capacitor with a ZrO dielectric is simulated and compared with measurements. Non-volatile memory devices such as conventional EEPROM devices, trap-rich dielectric devices, multi-barrier tunneling devices, and devices which use layered tunnel barriers to improve the retention time are investigated. With the implemented models, MINIMOS-NT can be used for the evaluation of tunneling currents in device structures of arbitrary complexity.},

In order to maximize sensitivity, the sample gas is first polarized using sub-{$\mu$}s chirped THz pulses and the free inductive decays (FIDs) are then detected using a heterodyne receiver. This approach allows for a rapid broadband multi-component sensing with low parts in 109 (ppb) sensitivities and spectral frequency accuracy of \&lt;20 kHz in real-time.

In molecules and clusters, the existence of multiple ionization and recombination sites makes for richer dynamics allowing imaging of molecular orbitals, higher conversion efficiency and the possibility of extending the high-energy cutoff. In the strong-field limit, HHG in bulk crystals is fundamentally different from that in the atomic case owing to the high density and periodic structure. Here we present the first observation of HHG in a bulk crystalline solid using a long-wavelength few-cycle laser. The harmonics spectra extend well beyond the band edge of the ZnO crystal, show a clear non-perturbative character and exhibit a cutoff that scales linearly with the electric field of the drive laser. Our results have important implications for the understanding of attosecond electron dynamics and other non-equilibrium band-structure-related phenomena in strongly driven bulk solids.},

  abstract = {We review the status of strong-field and attosecond processes in bulk transparent solids near the Keldysh tunneling limit. For high enough fields and low-frequency excitations, the optical and electronic properties of dielectrics can be transiently and reversibly modified within the applied pulse. In Ghimire et al (2011 Phys. Rev. Lett. 107 167407) non-parabolic band effects were seen in photon-assisted tunneling experiments in ZnO crystals in a strong mid-infrared field. Using the same ZnO crystals, Ghimire et al (2011 Nat. Phys. 7 138\textendash 41) reported the first observation of non-pertubative high harmonics, extending well above the bandgap into the vacuum ultraviolet. Recent experiments by Schubert et al (2014 Nat. Photonics 8 119\textendash 23) showed a carrier envelope phase dependence in the harmonic spectrum in strong-field 30 THz driven GaSe crystals which is the most direct evidence yet of the role of sub-cycle electron dynamics in solid-state harmonic generation. The harmonic generation mechanism is different from the gas phase owing to the high density and periodicity of the crystal. For example, this results in a linear dependence of the high-energy cutoff with the applied field in contrast to the quadratic dependence in the gas phase. Sub-100 attosecond pulses could become possible if the harmonic spectrum can be extended into the extreme ultraviolet (XUV). Here we report harmonics generated in bulk MgO crystals, extending to eV when driven by {$\sim$}35 fs, 800 nm pulses focused to a {$\sim$}1 V\AA{} peak field. The fundamental strong-field and attosecond response also leads to Wannier\textendash Stark localization and reversible semimetallization as seen in the sub-optical cycle behavior of XUV absorption and photocurrent experiments on fused silica by Schiffrin et al (2013 Nature 493 70\textendash 4) and Schultze et al (2013 Nature 493 75\textendash 8). These studies are advancing our understanding of fundamental strong-field and attosecond physics in solids with potential applications for compact coherent short-wavelength sources and ultra-high speed optoelectronics.},

A second approach is the determination of RIs of single intact cells by microscopic investigation. These techniques are limited to a few discrete wavelengths or a rather narrow wavelength range. In addition most of these techniques require additional information about the concentration dependence. In contrast, our approach yields the RI increment with Hb concentration of intact, reversibly isovolumetrically sphered, oxygenated RBCs over a wide wavelength range from 290\,nm to 1100\,nm from macroscopic measurements.},

Miniaturising powerful, dynamic and accurate actuators with a sufficient stroke is a considerable challenge. This paper presents a proof of concept of a tactile display, based on microhydraulic actuators. A prototype with five taxels is designed, built and evaluated. The result is a light and compact display. It is mobile, has a stroke of 2 mm, a spatial resolution of 2 mm and can exert a maximal force of 0.5 N. The actuation principle is innovative in the field of tactile displays and has a great potential.}

We briefly describe the most applied methodologies for its synthesis as well as the effect on surface area, electron transport and charge recombination when it is applied as an electron transport material in excitonic solar cells (XSCs). The importance of low-cost and easy-scalable synthesis techniques, as well as stability issues on these solar cells are discussed.

Think of the wonders we could witness firsthand: antibodies atta- ing a virus, electrical signals racing down nerve fibers, proteins building new strands of DNA. Many of the questions puzzling the current cadre of sci- tists would be answered at a glance. But the nanoscale world of molecules is separated from our everyday world of experience by a daunting million-fold difference in size, so the world of molecules is completely invisible. I created the illustrations in this book to help bridge this gulf and allow us to see the molecular structure of cells, if not directly, then in an artistic rendition. I have included two types of illustrations with this goal in mind: watercolor paintings which magnify a small portion of a living cell by one million times, showing the arrangement of molecules inside, and comput- generated pictures, which show the atomic details of individual molecules. In this second edition of The Machinery of Life, these illustrations are presented in full color, and they incorporate many of the exciting scientific advances of the 15 years since the first edition.},

  abstract = {High harmonic generation (HHG) is an extremely nonlinear effect generating coherent broadband radiation and pulse durations reaching attosecond timescales. Conventional models of HHG that treat the driving and emitted fields classically are usually very successful but inherently cannot capture the quantum-optical nature of the process. Although prior work considered quantum HHG, it remains unknown in what conditions the spectral and statistical properties of the radiation depart considerably from the known phenomenology of HHG. The discovery of such conditions could lead to novel sources of attosecond light having squeezing and entanglement. Here, we present a fully-quantum theory of extreme nonlinear optics, predicting quantum effects that alter both the spectrum and photon statistics of HHG, thus departing from all previous approaches. We predict the emission of shifted frequency combs and identify spectral features arising from the breakdown of the dipole approximation for the emission. Our results show that each frequency component of HHG can be bunched and squeezed and that each emitted photon is a superposition of all frequencies in the spectrum, i.e., each photon is a comb. Our general approach is applicable to a wide range of nonlinear optical processes, paving the way towards novel quantum phenomena in extreme nonlinear optics.},

In contrast to spontaneous emission of radiation from a random electron beam that is proportional to the number of particles, a prebunched electron beam can emit spontaneously coherent radiation proportional to the number of particles\textemdash squared, through the process of (spontaneous) superradiance (SP-SR) (in the sense of Dicke's). The coherent SP-SR emission of a bunched electron beam can be even further enhanced by a process of stimulated superradiance in the presence of a seed-injected radiation field. In this review, these coherent radiation emission processes for both single bunch and periodically bunched beams are considered in a model of radiation mode expansion. The general model of coherent spontaneous emission is extended to the nonlinear regime, particularly for undulator (wiggler) interaction: tapering-enhanced stimulated-superradiant amplification (TESSA). Processes of SP-SR and TESSA take place in tapered wiggler seed-injected free-electron lasers (FELs). In such FELs, operating in the x-ray regime, these processes are convoluted with other effects. However these fundamental emission concepts are useful guidelines for the strategy of wiggler tapering efficiency and power enhancement. Based on this model, previous theories and experiments are reviewed on coherent radiation sources based on SP-SR (coherent undulator radiation, synchrotron radiation, Smith-Purcell radiation, etc.), in the THz regime and on-going works on tapered wiggler efficiency-enhancement concepts in all optical frequency regimes up to x rays.},

  abstract = {A novel method of producing intense short wavelength radiation from relativistic electrons is described. The electrons are periodically bunched at the wavelength of interest enabling in-phase superradiant emission that is far more intense than from unbunched electrons. The periodic bunching is achieved in steps beginning with an array of beamlets emitted from a nanoengineered field emission array. The beamlets are then manipulated and converted to a longitudinal density modulation via a transverse-to-longitudinal emittance exchange. Periodic bunching at short wavelength is shown to be possible, and the partially coherent x-ray properties produced by inverse Compton scattering from an intense laser are estimated. The proposed method increases the efficiency of x-ray production by several orders of magnitude, potentially enabling compact x-ray sources to produce brilliance and flux similar to major synchrotron facilities.},

Here we report a large increase in silicon light-emitting diode power conversion efficiency to values above 1\% near room temperature\textemdash close to the values of representative direct bandgap emitters of a little more than a decade ago7,8. Our devices are based~on normally weak one- and two-phonon assisted sub-bandgap light-emission processes. Their design takes advantage of the reciprocity between light absorption and emission by maximizing absorption at relevant sub-bandgap wavelengths while reducing the scope for parasitic non-radiative recombination within the diode. Each feature individually is shown to improve the emission efficiency by a factor of ten, which accounts for the improvement by a factor of one hundred on the efficiency of baseline devices.},

Zhu and L. K. Ang, Appl. Phys. Lett. 98, 051502 (2011)]. These results are, in fact, verified using our own 1D PIC code.

But surface layers give off limited signals, so to probe these systems, scientists need to act fast. Gulde et al. developed an ultrafast low-energy electron diffraction technique and used it to study how a polymer moved and melted on a graphene substrate (see the Perspective by Nibbering). After hitting the sample with a laser pulse, energy transferred across the graphene-polymer interface, the polymer film became less orderly, and an amorphous phase appeared. Science, this issue p. 200; see also p. 137 Two-dimensional systems such as surfaces and molecular monolayers exhibit a multitude of intriguing phases and complex transitions. Ultrafast structural probing of such systems offers direct time-domain information on internal interactions and couplings to a substrate or bulk support. We have developed ultrafast low-energy electron diffraction and investigate in transmission the structural relaxation in a polymer/graphene bilayer system excited out of equilibrium. The laser-pump/electron-probe scheme resolves the ultrafast melting of a polymer superstructure consisting of folded-chain crystals registered to a free-standing graphene substrate. We extract the time scales of energy transfer across the bilayer interface, the loss of superstructure order, and the appearance of an amorphous phase with short-range correlations. The high surface sensitivity makes this experimental approach suitable for numerous problems in ultrafast surface science. Time-resolved low-energy electron diffraction resolves picosecond structural dynamics in a polymer-graphene bilayer.

Special attention is paid to the generation of ultrashort electron and hard X-ray pulses in table top setups, and a direct comparison in terms of brightness and temporal resolution between current table top and facility-based methodologies is given for proper calibration. This review is focused on ultrafast X-ray and electron diffraction techniques. The progress in the development of fs-structural probes during the last twenty years has been tremendous. Current ultrafast structural probes provide us with the temporal and spatial resolutions required to observe atoms in motion. Different compression approaches have made it possible the generation of ultrashort and ultrabright electron pulses with an effective brightness close to that of fs-hard X-ray pulses produced by free electron lasers.

Its exceptional properties, such as coherence and (sub)-femtosecond pulse durations, have led to a diversity of applications. Some of these require a high photon flux and megahertz repetition rates, for example, to avoid space charge effects in photoelectron spectroscopy. To date, this has only been achieved with enhancement cavities. Here, we establish a novel route towards powerful HHG sources. By achieving phase-matched HHG of a megahertz fibre laser we generate a broad plateau (25 eV\textendash 40 eV) of strong harmonics, each containing more than 1 \texttimes{} 1012 photons s\textendash 1, which constitutes an increase by more than one order of magnitude in that wavelength range. The strongest harmonic (H25, 30 eV) has an average power of 143 {$\mu$}W (3 \texttimes{} 1013 photons s\textendash 1). This concept will greatly advance and facilitate applications in photoelectron or coincidence spectroscopy, coherent diffractive imaging or (multidimensional) surface science.},

Upon recollision with the parent ion, the energy transferred from the field to the electron may be released as attosecond-duration extreme ultaviolet emission in the process of high-harmonic generation. The conventional sinusoidal driver fields set limitations on the maximum value of this energy transfer and the efficient return of the launched electron trajectories. It has been predicted that these limits can be significantly exceeded by an appropriately ramped-up cycle shape [L. E. Chipperfield et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 063003 (2009)]. Here, we present an experimental realization of similar cycle-shaped waveforms and demonstrate control of the high-harmonic generation process on the single-atom quantum level via attosecond steering of the electron trajectories. With our improved optical cycles, we boost the field ionization launching the electron trajectories, increase the subsequent field-to-electron energy transfer, and reduce the trajectory duration. We demonstrate, in realistic experimental conditions, 2 orders of magnitude enhancement of the generated extreme ultraviolet flux together with an increased spectral extension. This application, which is only one example of what can be achieved with cycle-shaped high-field light waves, has significant implications for attosecond spectroscopy and molecular self-probing.},

  abstract = {A systematic microscopic theory is presented for high-harmonic generation in III-V semiconductors that are excited by strongly detuned high-intensity electromagnetic pulses. As mechanism for the appearance of even harmonic orders, the quantum interference of different transition paths is analyzed. For the binary zinc blende semiconductors InAs, InP and GaAs, the intensity ratio between even- and odd-order harmonic emission depends on the strength of the respective inter-valence band dipole coupling. Whereas the large inter-valence band dipole in InP leads to even and odd harmonics of similar intensity, no or only very minor even-order emission due to quantum interference is predicted for InAs where the fundamental transition is strongly favored over inter-valence band transitions.This article is protected by copyright.

Subcycle pulses open the potential for non-adiabatic phase matching while concentrating the electric field so it can be used most efficiently. However, subcycle field transients have been difficult to generate. We exploit the perturbative response of a sub-100 \textmu m thick monocrystalline quartz plate irradiated by an intense few-cycle 1.8 \textmu m pulse, which creates a phase-controlled supercontinuum spectrum. Within the quartz, the pulse becomes space\textendash time coupled as it generates a parallel second harmonic. Vacuum propagation naturally leads to a subcycle electric-field transient whose envelope is sculpted by the carrier envelope phase of the incident radiation. We show that a second medium (either gas or solid) can generate isolated attosecond pulses in the extreme ultraviolet region. With no optical elements between the components, the process is scalable to very high energy pulses and allows the use of diverse media.},

Here a metal-sapphire nanostructure is devised to provide a solid tip as the HHG emitter, replacing commonly used gaseous atoms. The fabricated solid tip is made of monocrystalline sapphire surrounded by a gold thin-film layer, and intended to produce EUV harmonics by the inter- and intra-band oscillations of electrons driven by the incident laser. The metal-sapphire nanostructure enhances the incident laser field by means of surface plasmon polaritons, triggering HHG directly from moderate femtosecond pulses of {$\sim$}0.1\,TW\,cm-2 intensities. The measured EUV spectra exhibit odd-order harmonics up to {$\sim$}60\,nm wavelengths without the plasma atomic lines typically seen when using gaseous atoms as the HHG emitter. This experimental outcome confirms that the plasmonic HHG approach is a promising way to realize coherent EUV sources for nano-scale near-field applications in spectroscopy, microscopy, lithography and atto-second physics.},

A change in the response from that of single atoms or small molecules is observed from system sizes of N{$\approx$}6 nuclei and becomes independent of system size at N{$\greaterequivlnt$}60. The system-size dependence of the observed HHG cutoffs is found to follow the limitations, set by the finite-size solid, on the classical motion of electron-hole pairs. Because of the relation between recombination energy and electron-hole propagation length in the system, high-energy recombination events are not possible in small systems but become accessible for larger systems, resulting in the change of the cutoff energies with system size. When varying the field intensity we observe that the cutoffs move linearly with the intensity, even for small systems of N{$\greaterequivlnt$}6 that are far from the limit of a bulk solid.},

Time-integrated measurements of the nonlinear refractive index of matter indicate that the nonlinear response of bound electrons to optical fields is not instantaneous; however, a complete spectral characterization of the nonlinear susceptibility tensors\textemdash which is essential to deduce the temporal response of a medium to arbitrary driving forces using spectral measurements\textemdash has not yet been achieved. With the establishment of attosecond chronoscopy, the impulsive response of positive-energy electrons to electromagnetic fields has been explored through ionization of atoms and solids by an extreme-ultraviolet attosecond pulse or by strong near-infrared fields. However, none of the attosecond studies carried out so far have provided direct access to the nonlinear response of bound electrons. Here we demonstrate that intense optical attosecond pulses synthesized in the visible and nearby spectral ranges allow sub-femtosecond control and metrology of bound-electron dynamics. Vacuum ultraviolet spectra emanating from krypton atoms, exposed to intense waveform-controlled optical attosecond pulses, reveal a finite nonlinear response time of bound electrons of up to 115 attoseconds, which is sensitive to and controllable by the super-octave optical field. Our study could enable new spectroscopies of bound electrons in atomic, molecular or lattice potentials of solids, as well as light-based electronics operating on sub-femtosecond timescales and at petahertz rates.},

Limit of detection (LOD), rather than sensitivity, is chosen as a figure of merit. The Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for spectral shift estimation allows lower bounds to be placed on LOD independent of interrogation system and estimation algorithm. Analytic evaluation of the CRB for a Lorentzian spectral feature justifies common observations about the relationship between resonance line shape and sensor performance. Numerical evaluation of standard SPR sensor configurations shows that maximizing sensitivity is an insufficient criterion for minimizing limit of detection. Designs optimized for LOD are presented for common SPR sensor materials and geometries.},

  abstract = {Mammals receive light information through the eyes, which perform two major functions: image forming vision to see objects and non-image forming adaptation of physiology and behavior to light. Cone and rod photoreceptors form images and send the information via retinal ganglion cells to the brain for image reconstruction. In contrast, nonimage-forming photoresponses vary widely from adjustment of pupil diameter to adaptation of the circadian clock. nonimage-forming responses are mediated by retinal ganglion cells expressing the photopigment melanopsin. Melanopsin-expressing cells constitute 1\textendash 2\% of retinal ganglion cells in the adult mammalian retina, are intrinsically photosensitive, and integrate photic information from rods and cones to control nonimage-forming adaptation. Action spectra of ipRGCs and of melanopsin photopigment peak around 480\,nm blue light. Understanding melanopsin function lets us recognize considerable physiological effects of blue light, which is increasingly important in our modern society that uses light-emitting diode. Misalignment of circadian rhythmicity is observed in numerous conditions, including aging, and is thought to be involved in the development of age-related disorders, such as depression, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and cancer. The appropriate regulation of circadian rhythmicity by proper lighting is therefore essential. This perspective introduces the potential risks of excessive blue light for human health through circadian rhythm disruption and sleep deprivation. Knowing the positive and negative aspects, this study claims the importance of being exposed to light at optimal times and intensities during the day, based on the concept of the circadian clock, ultimately to improve quality of life to have a healthy and longer life.},

We treated one example of a simple linear system, namely a resonator coupled to a waveguide. Practical electromagnetic systems consist of RLC circuits, resonators, waveguide junctions, fibers, beam splitters, and, of course, amplifiers, to name only a few. Such systems, if linear, are described classically by impedance matrices or scattering matrices (Chap. 2) that are functions of frequency. This formalism is well developed in the classical domain. In this chapter, we review the classical formalism and its generalization to quantum theory. We define Hamiltonians which, via the Heisenberg equations of motion, lead to equations that are in direct correspondence with the classical circuit equations. If the multiports are lossy or exhibit gain, they must contain noise sources in order to conserve commutator brackets from input to output. The commutator brackets determine the minimum amount of noise added to the signal as it passes through the network. Hence one may determine the optimum noise measure achievable in a quantum circuit directly from these relations.},

Total internal reflection is utilized in the construction of dielectric waveguides at microwave frequencies as well as at optical frequencies. At optical frequencies these dielectric waveguides are realized as fibers. Optical beams can also be contained in free space, if periodically refocused by lenses or mirrors. Optical resonators can be built with two or more curved mirrors that balance the diffraction of the beam bouncing back and forth and maintain a resonance mode in the space between the mirrors.

If signal distortion is avoided, these devices are characterized as linear multiports. Of course, even linear multiports may distort a broadband signal by introducing frequency-dependent changes of the amplitudes and phases of the Fourier components of the signal. A linear multiport with loss does not only attenuate the signal, it also adds noise at thermal equilibrium. Linear multiports with gain amplify the signal, but also add noise in the process. In this chapter we study the basic noise properties of linear multiports. Linear multiports are described by an appropriate response matrix, which is a function of frequency, and a set of (Langevin) noise sources; there are N such sources for a multiport with N ports. Since the sources are generated by noise processes with a large number of degrees of freedom, they are usually Gaussian, according to the central limit theorem. Then, the correlation matrix of the noise sources, which is a function of frequency, is sufficient for their specification. In Sect. 4.7 we determined the noise sources for passive multi-ports at thermal equilibrium. Active multiports, such as amplifiers, contain noise sources that are determined by the physics of the amplifying process.},

The interpretation of quantum measurements has long been the subject of controversy. The von Neumann postulate [8] ``that the act of measurement projects the state of the observable into an eigenstate of the measurement apparatus'' is a good working hypothesis for the interpretation of a quantum measurement. However, it has been criticized by Bell [9,185] as being an add-on to quantum theory, which describes the evolution of the states of physical observables by the Schr\"odinger equation. The ``suddenness'' of the collapse of the wave function into an eigenstate also contradicts physical intuition.},

In a dispersionless fiber, the analysis proceeds by subdividing the pulse into time intervals containing rectangular segments of intensity, each of which generates squeezed radiation within its time segment. The governing equation was linearized. If the Kerr effect is treated as instantaneous, the full nonlinear analysis runs into singularities [171]. A kind of ultraviolet catastrophe is produced because the zero-point fluctuations at all frequencies mix eventually. The linearized analysis avoids this singularity, and can be proven to be adequate for reasonable distances of propagation and amounts of squeezing [109]. A more careful model of the Kerr nonlinearity that takes the finite response time of the Kerr medium into account also avoids the singularity [171]. A third approach, that of quantizing the time in terms of shortest allowable time intervals [172], avoids the singularity but leads to unphysical periodicities. The quantized soliton equations introduce a bandwidth limitation via dispersion. As a consequence, the quantum analysis of solitons avoids entirely the singularities associated with an instantaneous Kerr response.},

  abstract = {An optical fiber made of silica with a germanium core can support pulses, ``solitons'', that propagate undistorted if the fiber has negative dispersion at the carrier frequency of the pulses. The self-phase modulation of the pulse by the Kerr effect balances the dispersion [4]. Solitons have been proposed for repeaterless digital communications over transoceanic distances [5]. Instead of a signal composed of pulses and blanks being detected and regenerated every so often, as is done in conventional transoceanic communications, a signal consisting of solitons and empty time intervals would only be amplified every 25 km or so, without regeneration. This revolutionary proposal has been explored in extensive laboratory experiments [7, 87], but the first repeaterless transoceanic fiber communication cable, laid in 1995, uses fiber with close to zero dispersion and functions in what may be called the ``linear'' regime (self-phase modulation is not utilized, but since it is not entirely avoided, it is combatted by proper dispersion management along the fiber). The operation is called non-return-to-zero, or NRZ for short, as a description of the signal format: if two pulses are adjacent to each other, the pulse amplitude does not return to zero; two rectangular pulses merge into one pulse of double length (see Fig. 10.1). Whereas excellent performance has been achieved with operation in the linear NRZ format, and the bare essentials of the scheme are easily understood, no analytic theory exists for the description of the subtle nonlinear effects and dispersion effects that affect this mode of communications. Much better understanding has been developed for soliton operation, largely owing to the new mathematical methods developed for the analysis of a class of integrable nonlinear partial differential equations derivable from a Hamiltonian [88,89]. In this chapter we shall study only repeaterless soliton fiber communications, in part since the theory is elegant and well developed and in part because soliton communications may still find implementation, but mainly as a preparation for the analysis of the generation of squeezed radiation using solitons. Further, solitons passing through an amplifier are an interesting example of nonadditive noise, a case that transcends the linear additive noise analyses of the preceding chapters.},

Further, we gave an example of how squeezed vacuum, in conjunction with a coherent probe, can be used to improve the sensitivity of an interferometric measurement. In order to provide coherence between the probe and the squeezed vacuum, the pump radiation, at twice the frequency of the probe, had to be generated in a doubling crystal, coherently with the probe. The experiment is not a simple one; in particular, since coherence must be maintained across the entire experimental setup, changes in the different optical paths must be kept much smaller than an optical wavelength. It is difficult to maintain this coherence in adverse environmental conditions. For this reason one may look for methods of squeezing that are less subject to environmental effects. This can be done with fibers that possess the Kerr nonlinearity.},

  abstract = {The preceding chapter introduced general properties of Maxwell's equations. It identified power flow and energy density and derived the uniqueness theorem and the reciprocity theorem. This background is necessary for the analysis of metallic waveguides and resonators as used in microwave structures. In this chapter, we analyze the modes of waveguides with perfectly conducting cylindrical enclosures. We determine the mode patterns and the dispersion relations, i.e. the phase velocity as a function of frequency. We derive the velocity of energy propagation and show that it is equal to the group velocity, i.e. the velocity of propagation of a wavepacket formed from a superposition of sinusoidal excitations within a narrow band of frequencies. Then we study the modes in an enclosure, a so-called cavity resonator. We determine the orthogonality properties of the modes. Next, resonators coupled to the exterior via ``ports of access'' are analyzed. Their impedance matrix description is obtained and the reciprocity theorem is applied to the impedance matrix. This analysis is in preparation for the study of noise in multiports, which begins in Chap. 5. Finally, we look at resonators in a general context. The analysis is based solely on the concept of energy conservation and time reversal. The derivation is applicable to any type of resonator, be it microwave, optical, acoustic, or other. Most of the results obtained here are contained in the literature [21,27\textendash 30]. The concepts of the waveguide mode and of resonant modes are necessary for the quantization of electromagnetic systems. Even though the analysis in this chapter concentrates on waveguides and resonators in perfectly conducting enclosures, the generic approach to resonance is independent of the details of the electromagnetic mode and is based solely on the concept of losslessness and time reversibility. This is the approach used in the analysis and quantization of the modes of optical resonators.},

  abstract = {It is a long-standing goal to generate robust deterministic states of light with unique quantum properties, such as squeezing, sub-Poissonian statistics and entanglement. It is of interest to consider whether such quantum states of light could be generated by exploiting interactions with free electrons, going beyond their already ubiquitous use in generating classical light. This question is motivated by developments in electron microscopy, which present a new platform for manipulating photons through their interaction with quantum free electrons. Here, we explore the shaping of photon statistics using the quantum interactions of free electrons with photons in optical cavities. We find a variety of quantum states of light that can be generated by a judicious choice of the input light and electron states. For example, we show how shaping an electron into an energy comb can provide an implementation of a photon displacement operation, allowing, for instance, the generation of displaced Fock and displaced squeezed states. We also show how one can generate a desired Fock state by repeated interactions of electrons with a cavity, followed by measurements. We develop the underlying theory of the interaction of both a single and many consecutive electrons with a common cavity mode. Looking forward, by exploiting the degrees of freedom of arbitrary electron-photon quantum states, we may achieve complete control over the statistics and correlations of output photonic states, leading to the generation of novel quantum states of light.},

Here we introduce a pulsed control laser beam, orthogonally polarized to the driving pulses, and observe the ensuing electron dynamics. The relative delay between the two pulses is a tuning parameter to control the electron trajectory, now in a complex fashion exploring the full two-dimensional reciprocal space in graphene. Depending on the relative phase, the electron trajectory in the reciprocal space can, e.g., be deformed to suppress the quantum path interference resulting from the driving laser pulse. Intriguingly, this strong-field-based complex matter wave manipulation in a two-dimensional conductor is driven by a high repetition rate laser oscillator, rendering unnecessary complex and expensive amplified laser systems.},

Such currents are usually the result of an asymmetric population distribution imprinted by the temporal symmetry of the driving field. Here we compare two experimental schemes that allow control over the amplitude and direction of light-field-driven currents excited in graphene. Both schemes rely on shaping the incident laser field with one parameter only: either the carrier-envelope phase (CEP) of a single laser pulse or the relative phase between pulses oscillating at angular frequencies {$\omega$} and 2 {$\omega$} , both for comparable laser parameters. We observe that the efficiency in generating a current via two-color-control exceeds that of CEP control by more than two orders of magnitude (7 nA vs. 18 pA), as the {$\omega$} + 2 {$\omega$} field exhibits significantly more asymmetry in its temporal shape. We support this finding with numerical simulations that clearly show that two-color current control in graphene is superior, even down to single-cycle pulse durations. We expect our results to be relevant to experimentally access fundamental properties of any solid at ultrafast timescales, as well as for the emerging field of petahertz electronics.},

They are really the tails of the metal wave functions rather than separate states. In the past, the length of this tail has often been ignored. Some estimates of its length are made and its consequences pointed out. A semiquantitative discussion is given of various recent data, including the effect of an oxide layer on barrier height, the variation of barrier height with the metal, the work function of a free surface at high doping, and the effect of a cesium layer on the work function.},

Owing to the optimized gate structure, the concomitant decrease of the emission current was minimal, leading to a net enhancement of the current density. Furthermore, a noble gas conditioning process was successfully applied to the double-gate device to improve the beam uniformity in-situ with orders of magnitude increase of the active emission area.

The third harmonic emission spectrum thus depends strongly on the antenna shape and size as well as on its gap size. Despite the complex shape of the nanostructure, we find that for a large range of different geometries the nonlinear spectral properties are fully determined by the linear response of the antenna. We find excellent agreement between the measured spectra and predictions from a simple nonlinear oscillator model. We extract the oscillator parameters from the linear spectrum and use the amplitude of the nonlinear perturbation only as scaling parameter of the third harmonic spectra. Deviations from the model only occur for gap sizes below 20 nm, indicating that only for these small distances the antenna hot spot contributes noticeable to the third harmonic generation. Because of its simplicity and intuitiveness, our model allows for the rational design of efficient plasmonic nonlinear light sources and is thus crucial for the design of future plasmonic devices that give substantial enhancement of nonlinear processes such as higher harmonics generation as well as difference frequency mixing for plasmonically enhanced terahertz generation.},

In addition, they might be doped with transition metal (TM) ions to make spin-polarized light sources. To date, most of the work on ZnO nanostructures has focused on the synthesis methods and there have been only a few reports of the electrical characteristics. We review fabrication methods for obtaining device functionality from single ZnO nanorods. A key aspect is the use of sonication to facilitate transfer of the nanorods from the initial substrate on which they are grown to another substrate for device fabrication. Examples of devices fabricated using this method are briefly described, including metal-oxide semiconductor field effect depletion-mode transistors with good saturation behavior, a threshold voltage of \textasciitilde -3\dbend V and a maximum transconductance of order 0.3\dbend mS/mm and Pt Schottky diodes with excellent ideality factors of 1.1 at 25\dbend\dbend C and very low (1.5\dbend נ10-10\dbend A, equivalent to 2.35\dbend A\dbend cm-2, at -10\dbend V) reverse currents.

The attraction of nanostructures lies in two intimately connected features: local intensity enhancement and sub-wavelength confinement of optical fields. Local intensity enhancement facilitates access to the strong-field regime and has already sparked various applications, whereas spatial localization has the potential to generate strong-field dynamics exclusive to nanostructures. However, the observation of features unattainable in gaseous media is challenged by many-body effects and material damage, which arise under intense illumination of dense systems16, 17, 18, 19. Here, we non-destructively access this regime in the solid state by employing single plasmonic nanotips and few-cycle mid-infrared pulses, making use of the wavelength-dependence of the interaction, that is, the ponderomotive energy. We investigate strong-field photoelectron emission and acceleration from single nanostructures over a broad spectral range, and find kinetic energies of hundreds of electronvolts. We observe the transition to a new regime in strong-field dynamics, in which the electrons escape the nanolocalized field within a fraction of an optical half-cycle. The transition into this regime, characterized by a spatial adiabaticity parameter, would require relativistic electrons in the absence of nanostructures. These results establish new degrees of freedom for the manipulation and control of electron dynamics on femtosecond and attosecond timescales, combining optical near-fields and nanoscopic sources.},

  abstract = {The exact nondipole Volkov solutions to the Schr\"odinger equation and Pauli equation are found, based on which a strong field theory beyond the dipole approximation is built for describing the nondipole effects in nonrelativistic laser driven electron dynamics. This theory is applied to investigate momentum partition laws for multiphoton and tunneling ionization and explicitly shows that the complex interplay of a laser field and Coulomb action may reverse the expected photoelectron momentum along the laser propagation direction. The magnetic-spin coupling does not bring observable effects on the photoelectron momentum distribution and can be neglected. Compared to the strong field approximation within the dipole approximation, this theory works in a much wider range of laser parameters and lays a solid foundation for describing nonrelativistic electron dynamics in both short wavelength and midinfrared regimes where nondipole effects are unavoidable.},

However, such devices are not typically employed for high-harmonic generation. Here, using 200-fs, 10-nJ-level pulses of 4100-nm light at 1\&\#x00A0;MHz, we generate high harmonics up to the 13th harmonic (315\&\#x00A0;nm) in a chirped, periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide.

We find that the output spectrum depends on the waveguide poling period, indicating that quasi-phase-matching plays a significant role.

It represents an ultrafast electronic device based on light fields, exploiting near-field optical enhancement at surfaces of two metal nanotips. The sharper of the two tips displays a stronger field-enhancement, resulting in larger photoemission yields at its surface. One laser pulse with a peak intensity of 4.7\,\texttimes\,1011\,W/cm2 triggers photoemission of {$\sim$}16 electrons from the sharper cathode tip, while emission from the blunter anode tip is suppressed by 19\,dB to {$\sim$}0.2 electrons per pulse. Thus, the laser-triggered current between two tips exhibit a rectifying behavior, in analogy to classical vacuum-tube diodes. According to the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons and the distance between the tips, the total operation time of this laser-triggered nanoscale diode is estimated to be below 1 ps.},

Electromagnetic simulations using the finite element method support the existence of dipolar, quadrupolar, and hexapolar surface plasmon modes as well as centrosymmetric breathing modes depending on the location of the electron-beam excitation. In addition, we have developed an approach using nanolithography that is capable of meV control over the energy and attosecond control over the lifetime of volume plasmons in these nanodisks. The precise measurement of volume plasmon lifetime may also provide an opportunity to probe and control the DC electrical conductivity of highly confined metallic nanostructures. Lastly, we show the strong influence of the nanodisk boundary in determining both the energy and lifetime of surface plasmons and volume plasmons locally across individual aluminum nanodisks, and we have compared these observations to similar effects produced by scaling the nanodisk diameter.},

  abstract = {Understanding plasmon-mediated electron emission and energy transfer on the nanometer length scale is critical to controlling light\textendash matter interactions at nanoscale dimensions. In a high-resolution lithographic material, electron emission and energy transfer lead to chemical transformations. In this work, we employ such chemical transformations in two different high-resolution electron-beam lithography resists, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ), to map local electron emission and energy transfer with nanometer resolution from plasmonic nanoantennas excited by femtosecond laser pulses. We observe exposure of the electron-beam resists (both PMMA and HSQ) in regions on the surface of nanoantennas where the local field is significantly enhanced. Exposure in these regions is consistent with previously reported optical-field-controlled electron emission from plasmonic hotspots as well as earlier work on low-electron-energy scanning probe lithography. For HSQ, in addition to exposure in hotspots, we observe resist exposure at the centers of rod-shaped nanoantennas in addition to exposure in plasmonic hotspots. Optical field enhancement is minimized at the center of nanorods suggesting that exposure in these regions involves a different mechanism to that in plasmonic hotspots. Our simulations suggest that exposure at the center of nanorods results from the emission of hot electrons produced via plasmon decay in the nanorods. Overall, the results presented in this work provide a means to map both optical-field-controlled electron emission and hot-electron transfer from nanoparticles via chemical transformations produced locally in lithographic materials.},

Unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain all of these characteristics simultaneously. For example, modern transistor amplifiers offer multi-octave bandwidths and excellent dynamic range, but their noise remains far above the limit set by the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics. Parametric amplifiers can reach the quantum-mechanical limit, but generally are narrow band and have very limited dynamic range. Here we describe a parametric amplifier that overcomes these limitations through the use of a travelling-wave geometry and the nonlinear kinetic inductance of a superconducting transmission line. We measure gain extending over 2\,GHz on either side of an 11.56\,GHz pump tone and place an upper limit on the added noise of 3.4 photons at 9.4\,GHz. The dynamic range is very large, and the concept can be applied from gigahertz frequencies to {$\sim$} 1\,THz.},

A tungsten tip of several-ten-nanometers diameter mounted in a suppressor-extractor electrode configuration allows the generation of 30 keV electron pulses with an estimated pulse duration of 9 fs (standard deviation; 21 fs full width at half maximum) at the gun exit. We infer the pulse duration from particle tracking simulations, which are in excellent agreement with experimental measurements of the electron-optical properties of the source in the spatial domain. We also demonstrate femtosecond-laser triggered operation of the apparatus. The temporal broadening of the pulse upon propagation to a diffraction sample can be greatly reduced by collimating the beam. Besides the short electron pulse duration, a tip-based source is expected to feature a large transverse coherence and a nanometric emittance.},

  abstract = {Precise knowledge of the behaviour of the phase of light in a focused beam is fundamental to understanding and controlling laser-driven processes. More than a hundred years ago, an axial phase anomaly for focused monochromatic light beams was discovered and is now commonly known as the Gouy phase1,2,3,4. Recent theoretical work has brought into question the validity of applying this monochromatic phase formulation to the broadband pulses becoming ubiquitous today5,6. Based on electron backscattering at sharp nanometre-scale metal tips, a method is available to measure light fields with sub-wavelength spatial resolution and sub-optical-cycle time resolution7,8,9. Here we report such a direct, three-dimensional measurement of the spatial dependence of the optical phase of a focused, 4-fs, near-infrared pulsed laser beam. The observed optical phase deviates substantially from the monochromatic Gouy phase\textemdash exhibiting a much more complex spatial dependence, both along the propagation axis and in the radial direction. In our measurements, these significant deviations are the rule and not the exception for focused, broadband laser pulses. Therefore, we expect wide ramifications for all broadband laser\textendash matter interactions, such as in high-harmonic and attosecond pulse generation, femtochemistry10, ophthalmological optical coherence tomography11,12 and light-wave electronics13.},

One particular characterization method is frequency-resolved optical gating, which can be based on a large variety of third-order nonlinear effects. Any of these variants presupposes an instantaneous temporal response, as it is expected off resonance. In this paper we show that resonant excitation of the third harmonic gives rise to surprisingly large decay times, which are on the order of the duration of the shortest oscillator pulses generated to date. To this end, we measured interferometric third-harmonic frequency-resolved optical gating traces in TiO2 and SiO2, corroborating polarization decay times up to 6.5~fs in TiO2. This effect is among the fastest effects observed in ultrafast spectroscopy. Numerical solutions of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation are in excellent agreement with experimental observations. Our work (experiments and simulations) corroborates that a noninstantaneous polarization decay may appear in the presence of a 3-photon resonance. In turn, pulse generation and characterization in the ultraviolet may be severely affected by this previously unreported effect.},

Many devices are now coming to market that have no physical keyboards (the Apple iPhone being a very popular example). Touchscreen keyboards lack any tactile feedback and this may cause problems for entering text and phone numbers. We ran an experiment to compare devices with a physical keyboard, a standard touchscreen and a touchscreen with tactile feedback added. We tested this in both static and mobile environments. The results showed that the addition of tactile feedback to the touchscreen significantly improved finger-based text entry, bringing it close to the performance of a real physical keyboard. A second experiment showed that higher specification tactile actuators could improve performance even further. The results suggest that manufacturers should use tactile feedback in their touchscreen devices to regain some of the feeling lost when interacting on a touchscreen with a finger.},

Geometrically coupling out the intracavity generated XUV beam through a small on-axis hole in the cavity mirror following the HHG focus has enabled scaling the photon energies attainable with this technology to 100 eV and more, promising new applications of XUV frequency-comb spectroscopy and attosecond-temporal-resolution, multidimensional photoelectron spectroscopy and nanoscopy. So far, in this approach the features of the macroscopic response of the gas target are neither accessible directly nor indirectly via the out-coupled XUV beam due to the loss of spatial information caused by the truncation at the hole. Here, we derive a simple analytical model for the divergence of the intracavity harmonic beam as a function of experimental design parameters such as gas target position, cavity geometry and driving pulse intensity, thereby establishing a connection between the measured XUV spectra and the macroscopic response of the intracavity nonlinear medium. We verify this model by comparison to numerical simulations as well as to systematic measurements, and apply it to elucidate a trade-off between the efficiency of geometric output coupling and that of the HHG process, and the underlying physical mechanisms. These findings illuminate the share of the output coupling efficiency to the overall HHG conversion efficiency and provide\textemdash together with previously studied plasma-related enhancement limitations\textemdash a holistic means of optimizing the overall efficiency with this architecture that uniquely combines high repetition rates with high photon energies. Furthermore, quantitatively connecting the output coupled, observable XUV radiation to the nonlinear conversion at the cavity focus allows for a better insight into the dynamics of intracavity HHG and might benefit other applications of femtosecond enhancement cavities, such as high-repetition-rate HHG spectroscopy.},

For this application, transducers based on the Pockels electro-optic (EO) effect are promising for their direct conversion mechanism, high bandwidth, and potential for low-noise operation. However, previously demonstrated EO transducers require large optical pump power to overcome weak EO coupling and reach high efficiency. Here, we create an EO transducer in thin-film lithium niobate, leveraging the low optical loss and strong EO coupling in this platform. We demonstrate a transduction efficiency of up to \$2.7\textbackslash times10\^\{-5\}\$, and a pump-power normalized efficiency of \$1.9\textbackslash times10\^\{-6\}/\textbackslash mathrm\{\textbackslash mu W\}\$. The transduction efficiency can be improved by further reducing the microwave resonator's piezoelectric coupling to acoustic modes, increasing the optical resonator quality factor to previously demonstrated levels, and changing the electrode geometry for enhanced EO coupling. We expect that with further development, EO transducers in thin-film lithium niobate can achieve near-unity efficiency with low optical pump power.},

\item In the first paragraph of the experimental section on page 3, you mention that the laser power density is 100 mJ/cm\^2.~ I think there has to be an issue with units, as this is an energy density.~ Please clarify and/or explain this.

\item For Figure 2 could you please provide a clearer scale bar.~ It would be nice to easily determine the grating pitch visually.

\item In Figure 7, you show a setup that includes a spectrometer coupled to the fiber output.~ Where is the spectrum for this measurement?~ I feel the spectral shift should be shown as a function of refractive index change for this system as well.~

\item In Fig. 8 and in the text, are you calculating the integrated response across the same wavelengths as for the glass substrate? Please clarify this.

\item I feel the conclusions don't elaborate enough on what you did in this work (for instance usefulness/flexibility of the IL/template stripping method and your measurement results and implications for future sensor designs).~ You focus a lot on the polarization sensitivity and use as a means of background subtraction, but that is rather standard to my opinion, and not as relevant to the conclusions of this work.~

Minor Comments
\par
\begin{enumerate}

\item In the first paragraph of the experimental section on page 3, you start the sentence with the numeral 1.~ It should be spelled out.

\item On page 4, SPR was used without explicitly being defined.~ Please check all other abbreviations that they are defined upon first use.

\item Under Optical Fiber Measurements on page 4, you use SPR to start the sentence.~ I feel you should not start a sentence with an abbreviation.

Typically, these approaches dynamically steer a system towards states or reaction products far from equilibrium. In solids, metal-to-insulator transitions are an important target for optical manipulation, offering ultrafast changes of the electronic4 and lattice11\textendash 16 properties. The impact of coherences on the efficiencies and thresholds of such transitions, however, remains a largely open subject. Here, we demonstrate coherent control over a metal\textendash insulator structural phase transition in a quasi-one-dimensional solid-state surface system. A femtosecond double-pulse excitation scheme17\textendash 20 is used to switch the system from the insulating to a metastable metallic state, and the corresponding structural changes are monitored by ultrafast low-energy electron diffraction21,22. To govern the transition, we harness vibrational coherence in key structural modes connecting both phases, and observe delay-dependent oscillations in the double-pulse switching efficiency. Mode-selective coherent control of solids and surfaces could open new routes to switching chemical and physical functionalities, enabled by metastable and non-equilibrium states.},

It is confirmed that the RMS Johnson noise scattering of an aloof beam electron is proportional to its wavelength and to the square root of the temperature.

In the performance of magnetic spectrometers, the angular deflections due to the walls may be less significant than that generated in the slits. The angular deflections due to the many bremmstrahlung events in the spectrometer seem to be negligible but the influence of Johnson noise on them is beyond the scope of the classical Fermi theory and will need to be addressed by the quantum mechanical spontaneous wave theory.},

Among various methods, large-scale, gradient-based optimization techniques have been one of the most important ways to design a structure containing a vast number of degrees of freedom. These techniques are made possible by the adjoint method, in which the gradient of an objective function with respect to all design degrees of freedom can be computed using only two full-field simulations. However, this approach has so far mostly been applied to linear photonic devices. Here, we present an extension of this method to modeling nonlinear devices in the frequency domain, with the nonlinear response directly included in the gradient computation. As illustrations, we use the method to devise compact photonic switches in a Kerr nonlinear material, in which low-power and high-power pulses are routed in different directions. Our technique may lead to the development of novel compact nonlinear photonic devices.},

In this work, we propose a modification of boson sampling for the purpose of quantum simulation. In particular, we show that, by means of squeezed states of light coupled to a boson sampling optical network, one can generate molecular vibronic spectra, a problem for which no efficient classical algorithm is currently known. We provide a general framework for carrying out these simulations via unitary quantum optical transformations and supply specific molecular examples for future experimental realization.},

However, the necessary imaging methods combining attosecond temporal resolution with nanometre spatial resolution are currently lacking. Regular coherent diffractive imaging, based on the diffraction of quasi-monochromatic illumination by a sample, is inherently incompatible with the extremely broad nature of attosecond spectra. Here, we present an approach that enables coherent diffractive imaging using broadband illumination. The method is based on a numerical monochromatization of the broadband diffraction pattern by the regularized inversion of a matrix that depends only on the spectrum of the diffracted radiation. Experimental validations using visible and hard X-ray radiation show the applicability of the method. Because of its generality and ease of implementation we expect this method to find widespread applications such as in petahertz electronics or attosecond nanomagnetism.},

  abstract = {Attosecond science capitalizes on the extreme nonlinearity of strong fields, driven by few-cycle pulses, to attain attosecond temporal resolution and give access to the electron motion dynamics of matter in real-time. Here, we measured the electronic delay response of the dielectric system triggered by a strong field of few-cycle pulses to be in the order of 425 {$\pm$} 98 as. Moreover, we exploited the electronic response following the strong driver field to demonstrate all-optical light field metrology with attosecond resolution. This field sampling methodology provides a direct connection between the driver field and the induced ultrafast dynamics in matter. Also, we demonstrate the quantum electron motion control in dielectric using synthesized light waveforms. This on-demand electron motion control realizes the long-anticipated ultrafast optical switches and quantum electronics. This advancement promises to increase the limiting speed of data processing and information encoding to rates that exceed 1 petabit/s, opening a new realm of information technology.},

In quantum optics, plasmonic metal structures have been used to enhance nonclassical light emission from single quantum dots. Absorption and detection of single photons from free space could also be enhanced by nanometallic antennae, but this has not previously been demonstrated. Here, we use nano-optical transmission effects in a one-dimensional gold structure, combined with optical cavity resonance, to form optical nano-antennae, which are further used to couple single photons from free space into a 80-nm-wide superconducting nanowire. This antenna-assisted coupling enables a superconducting nanowire single-photon detector with 47\% device efficiency at the wavelength of 1550 nm and 9-{$\mu$}m-by-9-{$\mu$}m active area while maintaining a reset time of only 5 ns. We demonstrate nanoscale antenna-like structures to achieve exceptional efficiency and speed in single-photon detection.},

Direct (noniterative) inversion of the interferogram yields the electric field of the input pulse without ambiguity. The interferogram, which is solely a function of frequency, is resolved with a spectrometer and recorded with a slow detector. Moreover, the geometry is entirely collinear and requires no moving components. This paper describes in detail the principle of operation, apparatus, and calibration of SPIDER and gives experimental examples of reconstructed pulses.},

The results show that improved temperature stable operation around room temperature can only be achieved with a larger gain peak \textendash{} cavity mode de-tuning, offsetting the significant effect of increasing non-radiative recombination with increasing temperature, a physical effect which must be accounted for in mid-infrared VCSEL design.},

The gratings considered are sinusoidal, have depths of a few nanometers, and can produce significant surface plasmon polariton excitation at fundamental and second-harmonic frequencies. The calculations are based on a general expression for the nonlinear polarization of the surface of a homogeneous and isotropic medium, and the diffraction problems at the fundamental and harmonic frequencies are solved using a Rayleigh method. The silver gratings were fabricated using holographic lithography and evaporative metal deposition techniques. The samples were illuminated with picosecond pulses of wavelength 1064 nm, and photon-counting techniques were used to study the diffracted orders at 532 nm, with absolute normalization provided by a quartz reference. The diffracted orders exhibit anomalies and other features, many of which are related to plasmon polariton excitation at both fundamental and second-harmonic frequencies. Employing previously measured values for the nonlinear susceptibilities of a flat silver surface, remarkably good comparisons of theory and experiment are obtained for the second-harmonic order efficiencies.},

However, the maximum photon energy of attosecond pulses via HHG remains limited to the extreme ultraviolet region. Long-wavelength light sources with carrier-envelope phase stabilization are promising to extend the photon energy of attosecond pulses into the soft X-ray region. Here we demonstrate carrier-envelope phase-dependent HHG in the water window using sub-two-cycle optical pulses at 1,600 nm. Experimental and simulated results indicate the confinement of soft X-ray emission in a single recombination event with a bandwidth of 75 eV around the carbon K edge. Control of high harmonics by the waveform of few-cycle infrared pulses is a key milestone to generate soft X-ray attosecond pulses. We measure a dependence of half-cycle bursts on the gas pressure, which indicates subcycle deformation of the waveform of the infrared drive pulses in the HHG process.},

  abstract = {Smith\textendash Purcell (SP) radiation at wavelengths of 350\textendash 750nm was produced in a tabletop experiment using a field-emitter array (FEA) cathode. The electron gun was 5cm long, and a 25mm\texttimes 25mm holographic replica grating was placed behind the slit provided in the anode. A regulated DC power supply accelerated electron beams in excess of 10{$\mu$}A up to 45keV, while a small Van de Graaff generator accelerated smaller currents to higher energies. The grating had a 0.556{$\mu$}m period, 30\textdegree{} blaze and a 0.2{$\mu$}m thick aluminum coating. Spectral characteristics of the radiation were measured both manually and automatically; in the latter case, the spectrometer was driven by a stepping motor to scan the wavelength, and AD-converted signals from a photomultiplier tube were processed by a personal computer. The measurement, made at 80\textdegree{} relative to the electron beam, showed good agreement with theoretical wavelengths of the SP radiation. Diffraction orders were -2 and -3 for beam energies higher than 45keV, -3 to -5 at 15\textendash 25keV, and -2 to -4 in between. The experiment has thus provided evidence for the practical applicability of FEAs to compact radiation sources.},

Here, we examine in detail, using numerical simulations, the effect of the spatial and temporal properties of the light fields and of the experimental procedure on the accuracy of the method.

Soliton-dragging logic gates satisfy all requirements for a digital optical processor and having switching energies approaching 1 pJ. In addition, soliton-dragging logic gates are one example of a more general timedomain chirp switch architecture in which a dispersive delay line acts as a `lever-arm' to reduce the switching energy. Soliton-interaction gates are based on elastic collisions between solitons and illustrate that solitons can be used to implement conservative, billiard-ball logic operations. Soliton-trapping AND-gates are sensitive to the timing of the input pulses and display on/off contrast ratios greater than 20{$:$}1.

Our optically pumped 3.3um devices employ one or two wafer-bonded GaAs/AlGaAs mirrors, in conjunction with a type I InGaAsSb/AlInGaAsSb quantum well active region. Our electrically pumped 3.3um devices employ a bottom waferbonded GaAs/AlGaAs mirror, top deposited ZnSe/ThF4 mirror, and type II interband cascade (ICL) active region. These fixed wavelength devices lay a foundation for tunable devices in the spectrally rich 3-5um region. Narrowly tunable devices can use thermal tuning, by variation of pump power (optically pumped devices), bias current (electrically pumped devices), or device temperature (both electrically and optically pumped devices). In this paper, we describe tunable CW optically pumped devices with \&gt;4nm of tuning near 3.3um using variation of pump power. CW electrically pumped devices show \textasciitilde 2nm tuning near 3.3um using variation of bias current. These results are a critical first step towards an inexpensive and high-speed methane sensing source. A first generation of MEMS-tunable optically pumped devices has achieved 70nm tuning range near 3.34um.},

  abstract = {Typical qualitative experimental characterizations of current versus voltage [I(V)] for field emitters fundamentally rely on the Fowler\textendash Nordheim (FN) equation relating the current density J to the field at the surface F. The particular form of the J(F) relationship is due to taking the zero temperature limit of a linearized Wentzel\textendash Kramers\textendash Brillouin (LWKB) analysis, which works well for metals, but for semiconductors it is unsatisfactory, as LWKB does not correctly calculate the energy distribution of the emitted electrons, because the electron energy is too close to an extremum of the potential barrier, especially at high fields. Consequently, estimations of the current density from semiconductors can be substantially in error. We show how to modify the WKB approach so as to minimize its deviation from the exact solution of Schr\"odinger's equation, resulting in a modified WKB equation, and from it, a modified FN relation. J(F) will be compared for different semiconductors, and a comparison with metals is given. \textcopyright{} 1995 American Vacuum Society},

  abstract = {A novel method for the high-frequency modulation of a semiconductor field emitter array (FEA), as needed by compact high power microwave and millimeter wave tubes, is qualitatively analyzed. The model examines a FEA held at the threshold of emission by an applied gate potential from which current pulses are triggered by the application of a laser pulse on the backside of the semiconductor. Such an arrangement produces electron bunches (``density modulation'') at GHz frequencies without suffering from the restriction in reduced emission area and small unit cell geometry imposed by the high capacitance of field emitters. The analysis proceeds by first developing an analytical model of the emission from a silicon tip using a modified WKB approach to the tunneling current, which is validated by the more exact Airy function approach to solving Schr\"odinger's equation. The effects of band bending are explicitly accounted for. The resulting relations are used to estimate emission from a single hyperbolic structure, and generalized to an array where a distribution in tip radii and work function is possible. Using a simple relationship between the incident photon flux and the resultant electron density at the emission site, an estimation of the tunneling current is made. Finally, a brief description of the operation and design of such a ``photon-assisted field emission device'' is given.}

The method was originally developed for mechanical design problems but has within the last six years been applied to a range of photonics applications. Topology optimization may be based on finite element and finite difference type modeling methods in both frequency and time domain. The basic idea is that the material density of each element or grid point is a design variable, hence the geometry is parameterized in a pixel-like fashion. The optimization problem is efficiently solved using mathematical programming-based optimization methods and analytical gradient calculations. The paper reviews the basic procedures behind topology optimization, a large number of applications ranging from photonic crystal design to surface plasmonic devices, and lists some of the future challenges in non-linear applications.},

However their efficiencies have so far remained well below theoretical limits, which necessitates quantitative prediction of carrier transport and energy loss in plasmonic structures to identify and overcome bottlenecks in carrier harvesting. Here, we present a theoretical and computational framework, nonequilibrium scattering in space and energy (NESSE), to predict the spatial evolution of carrier energy distributions that combines the best features of phase-space (Boltzmann) and particle-based (Monte Carlo) methods. Within the NESSE framework, we bridge first-principles electronic structure predictions of plasmon decay and carrier collision integrals at the atomic scale, with electromagnetic field simulations at the nano- to mesoscale. Finally, we apply NESSE to predict spatially-resolved energy distributions of photoexcited carriers that impact the surface of experimentally realizable plasmonic nanostructures at length scales ranging from tens to several hundreds of nanometers, enabling first-principles design of hot carrier devices.},

Recently integrated chip-based frequency combs have been demonstrated in numerous platforms and the possibility of using these broadband chip-scale combs for OCT has been raised extensively over the past few years. However, the use of these chip-based frequency combs as light sources for OCT requires bandwidth and power compatibility with current OCT systems and have not been shown to date. Here we generate frequency combs based on chip-scale lithographically-defined microresonators and demonstrate its capability as a novel light source for OCT. The combs are designed with a small spectral line spacing of 0.21\&\#x2005;nm which ensure imaging range comparable to commercial system and operated at non-phase locked regime which provide conversion efficiency of 30\&\#x0025;. The comb source is shown to be compatible with a standard commercial spectral domain (SD) OCT system and enables imaging of human tissue with image quality comparable to the one achieved with tabletop commercial sources. The comb source also provides a path towards fully integrated OCT systems.},

The harmonics thus generated are also favourably phase-matched so that radiation is efficiently built up in the gas medium. Our results, combined with the emerging intense high-repetition MHz lasers, promise to increase harmonic yields by several orders to make harmonics feasible in the near future as general bright tabletop light sources, including intense attosecond pulses.},

We report octave span, controllable, and reversible tuning of {$\lambda$}ENZ from 1280\,nm to 2900\,nm in commercially available thin films of indium tin oxide (ITO), employing a low temperature annealing protocol. Electrical, spectroscopic, and optical measurements establish the physical basis of the observed tunability in free electron density by over an order of magnitude and quantify the real and imaginary components of the refractive index for ITO thin films. Excitation of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) in the metallic regime of ITO probes its infrared plasmonic response demonstrating continuous tunability of SPP frequency and crossover to the tunable ENZ plasmon mode in ultrathin films. Finally, dispersion tuning of optical fiber modes by optical coupling with a tunable {$\lambda$}ENZ platform is demonstrated by investigating modal interference in a tapered silica fiber in contact with various custom tuned ITO films.},

\section{Notes}

\subsection{210614 -- Journal Club Meeting}

\begin{itemize}

\item ~Interesting question about how the energy spread affects the experiment.

\begin{itemize}

\item Decided that it was likely not an issue for phot-field, but certainly for multiphoton/strong-field might become an issue as the energy spread starts to get worse.

\end{itemize}

\item Note -- If we were to drive the two separated gratings with an optical pulse, then we couple potentially do a time-resolved version of the IFM setup...

\end{itemize}

\par
Questions:
\par
\begin{enumerate}

\item Why is this different from holography?~

\begin{itemize}

\item I don't understand why they go to such lengths to make a distinction.~ It seems it is basically the same, but slightly modified?~

\item Need to better understand the distinction.~

We study the energy transfer from a strong infrared (IR) laser field to the ionized electrons as a function of the delay between the XUV and IR fields. When the wave packets are born at the zero crossings of the IR field, a significant amount of energy ({$\sim$}20 eV) is transferred from the field to the electrons. This results in dramatically enhanced above-threshold ionization in conditions where the IR field alone does not induce any significant ionization. Because both the energy and duration of the wave packets can be varied independently of the IR laser, they are valuable tools for studying and controlling strong-field processes.},

  abstract = {Chemically synthesized metallic nanostructures can exhibit a strong local optical field enhancement associated with their high degree of crystallinity and well-defined geometry-dependent surface plasmon resonances. The extension of the plasmon modes into the mid-IR spectral range (3-30 {$\mu$}m) is shown for micrometer-sized nanowires with high aspect ratios available in the form of pentagonally twinned Ag crystallites as grown by polyol synthesis. Using scattering-scanning near-field optical microscopy, the associated IR plasmon modes are identified, and their underlying spatial distribution and enhancement of the optical polarization density is measured via phase, amplitude, and polarization resolved optical vector-field mapping. The transition from dipolar to multipolar resonances is observed and described by modeling the Ag wires using a modified cylindrical waveguide theory. For 10.6 {$\mu$}m excitation, dipole antenna resonances are observed at a resonant length of L = {$\lambda$}eff/2 with {$\lambda$}eff {$\approx$} 10.6 {$\mu$}m/(1.8 {$\pm$} 0.5) {$\approx$} 6 {$\pm$} 2 {$\mu$}m. This effective wavelength scaling is the result of electronic damping, despite the high aspect ratios of the wires of order 1:10 to 1:200. With the optical cycle period {$\tau$}IR being comparable to the Drude relaxation time of {$\tau$} {$\sim$} 40 fs the mid-IR defines the low-energy limit of the coherent plasmon regime ({$\tau$}IR {$\lessequivlnt$} {$\tau$}) at the transition to purely geometric antenna resonances ({$\tau$}IR {$>$} {$\tau$}).},

Being able to tune the exciton energy would bring functional flexibility to such devices. Although tunable excitons have been predicted to form in bilayer graphene, observing them experimentally has been difficult. Ju et al. used high-quality bilayer graphene samples sandwiched between layers of hexagonal boron nitride to observe excitons in this material. Exciton energy was tuned across a large range by controlling the gate voltages. Science, this issue p. 907 Excitons, the bound states of an electron and a hole in a solid material, play a key role in the optical properties of insulators and semiconductors. Here, we report the observation of excitons in bilayer graphene (BLG) using photocurrent spectroscopy of high-quality BLG encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride. We observed two prominent excitonic resonances with narrow line widths that are tunable from the mid-infrared to the terahertz range. These excitons obey optical selection rules distinct from those in conventional semiconductors and feature an electron pseudospin winding number of 2. An external magnetic field induces a large splitting of the valley excitons, corresponding to a g-factor of about 20. These findings open up opportunities to explore exciton physics with pseudospin texture in electrically tunable graphene systems\hspace{0pt}.

Quantitative information about the guise is not readily obtainable from its spectrogram without the use of a two-dimensional phase retrieval algorithm. While current algorithms are quite robust, retrieval of all the pulse information can be slow. In this paper, I describe a recently developed FROG trace inversion algorithm called Principal Component Generalized Projects that is fast, robust, and can invert FROG traces in real time.

We report two complementary methods for the massive assembly of large-size ZnO nanowires (NWs). In the solution-phase method, ZnO NWs were assembled and aligned selectively onto negatively charged surface patterns in solution. In addition, the substrate bias voltage and capillary forces can be used to further enhance the adsorption rate and degree of alignment of ZnO NWs, respectively. In the direct-transfer method, a NW film grown on a solid substrate was placed in close proximity to a molecule-patterned substrate, and ultrasonic vibration was applied so that the NWs were directly transferred and aligned onto the patterned substrate. The solution-phase and direct-transfer methods are complementary to each other and suitable for the assembly of NWs prepared in solution and on solid substrates, respectively.}

A conventional video-rate centimeter-range OCT requires an optical source with hundreds of kHz repetition rate and needs the support of broadband detectors and electronics (\&gt;1 GHz). In this paper, a type of video-rate centimeter-range OCT system is proposed and demonstrated based on dual optical frequency combs by leveraging electro-optic modulators. The repetition rate difference between dual combs, i.e. the A-scan rate of dual-comb OCT, can be adjusted within 0\textasciitilde 6 MHz. By down-converting the interference signal from optical domain to radio-frequency domain through dual comb beating, the down-converted bandwidth of the interference signal is less than 22.5 MHz which is at least two orders of magnitude lower than that in conventional OCT systems. A LabVIEW program is developed for video-rate operation, and the centimeter imaging depth is proved by using 10 pieces of 1-mm thick glass stacked as the sample. The effective beating bandwidth between two optical comb sources is 7 nm corresponding to \textasciitilde 108 comb lines, and the axial resolution of the dual-comb OCT is 158 \&\#x00B5;m. Dual optical frequency combs provide a promising solution to relax the detection bandwidth requirement in fast long-range OCT systems.},

Here, we demonstrate that 14 fs optical pulses in the near-infrared (NIR) can drive electronic on-chip circuits with a bandwidth up to 10 THz. The corresponding electronic pulses propagate in microscopic striplines on a millimeter scale. We exploit femtosecond photoswitches based on tunneling barriers in nanoscale metal junctions to drive the pulses. The non-linear ultrafast response is based on a combination of plasmonically enhanced, multi-photon absorption and quantum tunneling, and gives rise to a field emission of ballistic electrons propagating across the nanoscale junctions.

  abstract = {Coherent emission of light by free charged particles is ubiquitous in many areas of physics and engineering, with the light's properties believed to be successfully captured by classical electromagnetism in all relevant experimental settings. The advent of interactions between light and free quantum matter waves brought about fundamental questions regarding the role of the particle wavefunction. Here we show that even in seemingly classical experimental regimes, light emission is fundamentally tied to quantum properties of the emitting particles, such as their quantum coherence and correlations. By employing quantum electrodynamics, we unveil the role of the particle's coherent momentum uncertainty, without which decoherence of light becomes dominant. As an example, we consider Cherenkov radiation, envisioned for almost a century as a shockwave of light. We find instead that the shockwave's duration is fundamentally bound from below by the particle's coherent momentum uncertainty due to the underlying entanglement between the particle and light. This quantum optical paradigm opens new capabilities in analytical electron microscopy, enabling the measurement of quantum correlations of shaped electron wavepackets. Our findings also have applications for Cherenkov detectors in particle physics. For example, by measuring spectral photon autocorrelations, one can unveil the particle's wavefunction size, shape and coherence. Such schemes are especially intriguing for many high-energy particles, where other techniques are not available.},

  abstract = {X-ray crystallography is one of the main methods to determine atomic-resolution 3D images of the whole spectrum of molecules ranging from small inorganic clusters to large protein complexes consisting of hundred-thousands of atoms that constitute the macromolecular machinery of life. Life is not static, and unravelling the structure and dynamics of the most important reactions in chemistry and biology is essential to uncover their mechanism. Many of these reactions, including photosynthesis which drives our biosphere, are light induced and occur on ultrafast timescales. These have been studied with high time resolution primarily by optical spectroscopy, enabled by ultrafast laser technology, but they reduce the vast complexity of the process to a few reaction coordinates. In the AXSIS project at CFEL in Hamburg, funded by the European Research Council, we develop the new method of attosecond serial X-ray crystallography and spectroscopy, to give a full description of ultrafast processes atomically resolved in real space and on the electronic energy landscape, from co-measurement of X-ray and optical spectra, and X-ray diffraction. This technique will revolutionize our understanding of structure and function at the atomic and molecular level and thereby unravel fundamental processes in chemistry and biology like energy conversion processes. For that purpose, we develop a compact, fully coherent, THz-driven attosecond X-ray source based on coherent inverse Compton scattering off a free-electron crystal, to outrun radiation damage effects due to the necessary high X-ray irradiance required to acquire diffraction signals. This highly synergistic project starts from a completely clean slate rather than conforming to the specifications of a large free-electron laser (FEL) user facility, to optimize the entire instrumentation towards fundamental measurements of the mechanism of light absorption and excitation energy transfer. A multidisciplinary team formed by laser-, accelerator,- X-ray scientists as well as spectroscopists and biochemists optimizes X-ray pulse parameters, in tandem with sample delivery, crystal size, and advanced X-ray detectors. Ultimately, the new capability, attosecond serial X-ray crystallography and spectroscopy, will be applied to one of the most important problems in structural biology, which is to elucidate the dynamics of light reactions, electron transfer and protein structure in photosynthesis.},

Slow saturable absorbers can already generate almost transform limited pulses much shorter than the recovery time of the absorber. If soliton-like pulse shaping is present in addition the pulses can be further compressed below the resulting net gain window until either the continuum breaks through or the pulses break up into multiple pulses, which sets a limit to the shortest pulsewidth achievable. Given a certain amount of saturable absorption, a comparison is made that results in an estimate for the shortest pulse achievable for a solitary laser stabilized by a fast or a slow saturable absorber.

Kealhofer et al. describe an ultrafast optics approach for generating bunches of electrons and compressing them by more than an order of magnitude to just femtosecond time scales (see the Perspective by Ropers). The technique opens up the possibility of imaging ultrafast phenomena with atomic-scale spatial resolution. Science, this issue p. 429; see also p. 410 Short electron pulses are central to time-resolved atomic-scale diffraction and electron microscopy, streak cameras, and free-electron lasers. We demonstrate phase-space control and characterization of 5-picometer electron pulses using few-cycle terahertz radiation, extending concepts of microwave electron pulse compression and streaking to terahertz frequencies. Optical-field control of electron pulses provides synchronism to laser pulses and offers a temporal resolution that is ultimately limited by the rise-time of the optical fields applied. We used few-cycle waveforms carried at 0.3 terahertz to compress electron pulses by a factor of 12 with a timing stability of {$<$}4 femtoseconds (root mean square) and measure them by means of field-induced beam deflection (streaking). Scaling the concept toward multiterahertz control fields holds promise for approaching the electronic time scale in time-resolved electron diffraction and microscopy. An ultrafast optics approach is used to generate and control ultrashort pulses of electrons.

Two-photon emission is observed at low power with a moderate electric bias field applied to the tips. As the bias field and/or laser power is increased, the average current becomes dominated by thermally enhanced field emission due to laser heating: both the low thermal conductivity of HfC and the laser's high repetition rate can lead to a temperature rise of several hundred Kelvin at the tip apex. The contribution of current from a thermal transient at times shorter than the electron-phonon coupling time is considered in the context of the two-temperature model (TTM). Under the conditions of this experiment, the integrated current from the thermal transient is shown to be negligible in comparison with the two-photon emission. A finite element model of the laser heating and thermal conduction supports these conclusions and is also used to compare the nature of thermal effects in HfC, tungsten, and gold tips.},

  abstract = {Given the quasi-static nature of optical-field emission and the nontrivial dependence of the emission rate on the instantaneous electric field strength, the CEP-sensitive component of the emitted photocurrent is highly sensitive to the energy of the optical pulse, and should carry information about the underlying sub-cycle dynamics of electron emission. Here we examine CEP-sensitive photoemission from plasmonic gold nanoantennas excited with few-cycle optical pulses of increasing energy. We observe antiresonance-like features in the CEP-sensitive photocurrent; specifically, at a critical pulse energy, we observe a sharp dip in the magnitude of the CEP-sensitive photocurrent accompanied by a sudden shift of \{\textbackslash pi\}-radians in the phase of the photocurrent. Using a quasi-static tunneling emission model, we find that these antiresonance-like features arise due to competition between electron emission from neighboring optical half-cycles, and that they are highly sensitive to the precise shape of the driving optical waveform at the surface of the emitter. As the underlying mechanisms that produce the antiresonance-like features are a general consequence of nonlinear, field-driven photoemission, the antiresonance-like features could be used to probe sub-optical-cycle, sub-femtosecond emission processes, not only from solid-state emitters, but also from gas-phase atoms and molecules. Beyond applications in the study of ultrafast, field-driven electron physics, an understanding of these antiresonance-like features will be critical to the development of novel photocathodes for future time-domain metrology and microscopy applications that demand both attosecond temporal and nanometer spatial resolution.},

Around this transition, we measure an enhanced emission rate as well as intensity-dependent structure in the photoelectron yield from the illuminated nanostructures. Numerically solving the time-dependent Schr\textbackslash "odinger equation (TDSE), we demonstrate that the excess emission derives from the build-up of standing electronic wavepackets near the surface of the silicon, and the intensity dependent structure in this transition results from the increased ponderomotive potential and channel closing effects. By way of time-dependent perturbation theory (TDPT), we then show that the visibility of intensity dependent structure, the transition rate from multiphoton to optical-field emission, and scaling rate at high intensities are all consistent with a narrow band of ground-state energies near the conduction band dominating the emission process in silicon. These results highlight the importance of considering both coherent electron wavepacket dynamics at the emitter surface as well as the ground-state energy distribution when interpreting strong-field photoemission from solids.},

The structures are prepared from highly doped single-crystal silicon having a pencil- like shape with end radii of curvature of around 10 nm. The tips were illuminated at a grazing incidence of roughly 84o with a 1 kHz titanium sapphire laser beam having a center wavelength of 800 nm, and a pulse duration of 35 fs. At lower pulse energies (hundreds of nJ) and electron yields, the Si tips, still coated with native oxide, were characterized using a time of flight (TOF) electron energy spectrometer. This revealed an annealing process occurring when the tips were exposed to higher pulse energies (greater than 1 {$\mu$}J), resulting in a red shift of the energy spectra along with an increased electron yield. Furthermore, the energy spectra demonstrate the development of a broad, high-energy plateau that scales with incident pulse energy. These effects are described through a modified Fowler-Nordheim tunneling model that includes a thinning oxide layer along with electron re-scattering from the tip surface. Electron currents were then studied at higher pulse energies using similar tip structures with minimal native oxide growth on the surface. The tips were exposed to energies exceeding 7 uJ corresponding to a peak intensity of around 3.2x1012 W/cm2. By fixing the incident pulse energy, an increase in current was also observed when increasing the bias potential. At a bias potential of 70 V, a peak total emission of 0.68 pC/bunch, corresponding to around 1.5x103 electrons/tip/pulse, was observed.}

Secondly, the LOD of this design is compared with that of an optimized planar dual-mode design. Through this analysis, it is shown that the LOD of the planar sensor can be improved upon by around a factor of 7 when compared with the nano-gap-enhanced design. Furthermore, with the nano-gap design, the lower wavelength plasmon mode demonstrates remarkably improved selectivity when compared with the conventional sensor. In order to explain these results, the dispersion of each plasmon mode along with the electromagnetic field profiles are modeled and analyzed.},

  abstract = {We discuss photoelectron emission from an arrays of high aspect ratio, sharp Si emitters both experimentally and theoretically. The structures are prepared from highly doped single-crystal silicon having a pencil-like shape with end radii of curvature of around 10 nm. The tips were illuminated at a grazing incidence of roughly 84deg.with a laser pulse having a center wavelength of 800 nm, and a pulse duration of 35 fs from a regenerative amplifier system. Native oxide coated Si tips were characterized using a time of flight (TOF) electron energy spectrometer. An annealing process was observed, resulting in a red shift of the energy spectra along with an increased electron yield. Total current yield from samples having the oxide stripped were also studied. Apeak total emission of 0.68 pC/bunch, corresponding to around 1.5x10\^3 electrons/tip/pulse was observed at a DC bias of 70 V . Both spectral and current characterization results are consistent with a stong-field photoemission process at the surface of the tip apex.},

It is shown that a model based on strong-field perturbation theory accounting for tip enhancement and both spatial and temporal averaging over the driving pulse provides an accurate description of the emission process from the multiphoton to the tunneling regime. Electron energy spectra are also shown to contain characteristic features of laser acceleration and rescattering of the electron from the nano tip. Two-color cross correlation measurements of emission from the tips between a 2 {$\mu$}m and 1 {$\mu$}m pulse confirm ultrafast emission, and show that the electron energy spectra can be shaped by altering the electromagnetic field profile of the driving pulse.},

  abstract = {At the surfaces of nanostructures, enhanced electric fields can drive optical-field photoemission and thereby generate and control electrical currents at frequencies exceeding 100\,THz (refs. 1\textendash 11). A hallmark of such optical-field photoemission is the sensitivity of the total emitted current to the carrier-envelope phase (CEP)1\textendash 3,7,11\textendash 17. Here, we examine CEP-sensitive photoemission from plasmonic gold nanoantennas excited with few-cycle optical pulses. At a critical pulse energy, which we call a vanishing point, we observe a pronounced dip in the magnitude of the CEP-sensitive photocurrent accompanied by a sudden shift of {$\pi$} radians in the photocurrent phase. Analysis shows that this vanishing behaviour arises due to competition between sub-optical-cycle electron emission events from neighbouring optical half-cycles and that both the dip and phase shift are highly sensitive to the precise shape of the driving optical waveform at the surface of the emitter. As the mechanisms underlying the dip and phase shift are a general consequence of nonlinear, field-driven photoemission, they may be used to probe sub-optical-cycle emission processes from solid-state emitters, atoms and molecules. Improved understanding of these CEP-sensitive photocurrent features will be critical to the development of optical-field-driven photocathodes for time-domain metrology and microscopy applications demanding attosecond temporal and nanometre spatial resolution.},

EOS in particular features outstanding sensitivity and ease of use, making it the basis of time-resolved spectroscopic measurements for studying charge carrier dynamics and active optical devices.

Over the past decade, the manipulation and interaction of electrons with optical fields have enabled considerable progress in imaging methods4, near-field electron acceleration5,6, and four-dimensional microscopy techniques with high temporal and spatial resolution7. However, electron beams typically couple only weakly to optical excitations, and emerging applications in electron control and sensing8\textendash 11 require large enhancements using tailored fields and interactions. Here we couple a free-electron beam to a travelling-wave resonant cavity mode. The enhanced interaction with the optical whispering-gallery modes of dielectric microresonators induces a strong phase modulation on co-propagating electrons, which leads to a spectral broadening of 700 electronvolts, corresponding to the absorption and emission of hundreds of photons. By mapping the near-field interaction with ultrashort electron pulses in space and time, we trace the lifetime of the the microresonator following a femtosecond excitation and observe the spectral response of the cavity. The natural matching of free electrons to these quintessential optical modes could enable the application of integrated photonics technology in electron microscopy, with broad implications for attosecond structuring, probing quantum emitters and possible electron\textendash light entanglement.},

  abstract = {Semiconductor disk lasers have been shown to be ideal as wavelength-agile, high-brightness sources for producing high average power under various pulsed mode-locking scenarios. Systematic microscopic modeling reveals that ultrafast nonequilibrium kinetic hole burning in electron/hole carrier distributions dictates the outcome of femtosecond duration mode-locked pulse formation. The existence of a large reservoir of unsaturated carriers within the inverted distributions leads to the emergence of multiple pulse waveforms (not necessarily harmonically mode-locked pulse trains) that inefficiently draw on these carrier reservoirs. The concept of gain is no longer meaningful in this limit, and the dynamical inversion of electrons and holes primarily in the active medium establishes the final dynamical state of the system. The simulation results explain much of the generic behavior observed in key recent experiments and point to the difficulty of pushing semiconductor mode-locked lasers to pulse durations below 100~fs.},

The results calculated by rigorous coupled-wave analysis on a model using a hexanedithiol self-assembled monolayer (SAM) indicate that the resonant coupling between localized surface plasmons (LSPs) of nanowires affects the sensitivity enhancement substantially, while the LSP resonance in a single nanowire also contributes. SPR characteristics change significantly by applying a SAM, which can give rise to zero sensitivity for a given SAM. The results suggest that a properly designed nanowire-based SPR biosensor can enhance sensitivity by an order of magnitude with reasonable detection properties.},

The EUV output exceeds 107 photons per second without causing drastic thermal damage due to the high heat dissipation capabilities of bulk sapphire. In addition, the free-space EUV propagation can be steered by shaping the bulk surface without requiring extra grazing incidence mirrors.

Here, we introduce and demonstrate an all-optical method to measure the space\textendash time characteristics of an isolated attosecond pulse. Our measurements show that intensity-dependent phase and quantum-path interference both play a key role in determining the pulse structure. In the generating medium, the attosecond pulse is strongly modulated in space and time. Propagation modifies but does not erase this modulation. Quantum-path interference of the single-atom response, previously obscured by spatial and temporal averaging, may enable measuring the laser-field-driven ion dynamics with sub-cycle resolution.},

Here, we show that nonlinear optical mixing in a medium in which attosecond pulses are being generated can also be used to measure the time-dependent field of an optical pulse. The gate is the phase accumulated by the recollision electron during the subcycle time interval between ionization and recombination. We show that the instantaneous field of an unknown pulse is imprinted onto the deflection of the attosecond extreme ultraviolet pulse using an all-optical set-up with a bandwidth up to 1 PHz.},

Using intense lightwaves to precisely control the fast carrier dynamics in crystals holds great promise for next-generation petahertz electronics and devices. The carrier dynamics can produce high-order harmonics of the driving field extending up into the extreme-ultraviolet region. Here, we introduce polarization-state-resolved high-harmonic spectroscopy of solids, which provides deeper insights into both electronic and structural sub-cycle dynamics. Performing high-harmonic generation measurements from silicon and quartz, we demonstrate that the polarization states of the harmonics are not only determined by crystal symmetries, but can be dynamically controlled, as a consequence of the intertwined interband and intraband electronic dynamics. We exploit this symmetry-dynamics duality to efficiently generate coherent circularly polarized harmonics from elliptically polarized pulses. Our experimental results are supported by ab-initio simulations, providing evidence for the microscopic origin of the phenomenon.},

To gain insights on the microscopic origin of this behavior, we perform one-particle intraband-only calculations and reproduce some of the most striking observations. For instance, our calculations yield circularly polarized harmonics from elliptically polarized pulses that sensitively depend on the driving conditions. Furthermore, we perform experiments on ZnS and find characteristics partly similar to those reported from silicon. Comparison to our intraband-only calculations shows reasonable qualitative agreement for a below-band-gap harmonic. We show that intraband dynamics predict depolarization effects that gain significance with higher field strengths and we observe such effects in the experimental data. For harmonics above the band gap, interband dynamics become important and the high-harmonic response to elliptical excitation looks systematically different. Our work proposes a method to distinguish between different high-harmonic generation mechanisms and it could pave the way to compact solid-state high-harmonic sources with controllable polarization states.},

Two ultra-compact Ti:sapphire femtosecond ring lasers allow to achieve scan rates as high as 100 kHz for a 100 ps long time window and a time-delay resolution of 100 fs. The feasibility of this high-speed ASOPS system is evaluated by performing THz time domain spectroscopy on molecular gases where signal-to-noise ratios exceeding 30 dB for averaging times in the millisecond range have been obtained. In order to demonstrate the benefits of this system for ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy we demonstrate the high-sensitivity detection of coherent acoustic phonons with dephasing times in the range of the 100 ps time window.},

This extended response, combined with its natural abundance, low cost, and amenability to manufacturing processes, makes aluminum a highly promising material for commercial applications. Fabricating Al-based nanostructures whose optical properties correspond with theoretical predictions, however, can be a challenge. In this work, the Al plasmon resonance is observed to be remarkably sensitive to the presence of oxide within the metal. For Al nanodisks, we observe that the energy of the plasmon resonance is determined by, and serves as an optical reporter of, the percentage of oxide present within the Al. This understanding paves the way toward the use of aluminum as a low-cost plasmonic material with properties and potential applications similar to those of the coinage metals.},

One of the greatest challenges now is to implement the basic quantum-computational elements in a physical system and to demonstrate that they can be reliably and scalably controlled. One of the earliest proposals for quantum computation is based on implementing a quantum bit with two optical modes containing one photon. The proposal is appealing because of the ease with which photon interference can be observed. Until now, it suffered from the requirement for non-linear couplings between optical modes containing few photons. Here we show that efficient quantum computation is possible using only beam splitters, phase shifters, single photon sources and photo-detectors. Our methods exploit feedback from photo-detectors and are robust against errors from photon loss and detector inefficiency. The basic elements are accessible to experimental investigation with current technology.},

The measured spectra consist of both odd- and even-order harmonics, with a high-energy cutoff extending beyond the 15th order for a laser-field strength around \&\#x007E;1\&\#x2009;V/nm. In WS\textsubscript{2}, we find that the polarization direction of the odd-order harmonics smoothly follows that of the laser field irrespective of the crystal orientation, whereas the direction of the even-order harmonics is fixed by the crystal mirror planes. Furthermore, the polarization of the even-order harmonics shows a flip in the course of crystal rotation when the laser field lies between two of the crystal mirror planes. By numerically solving the semiconductor Bloch equations for a gapped-graphene model, we qualitatively reproduce these experimental features and find the polarization flipping to be associated with a significant contribution from interband polarization. In contrast, high-harmonic signals from MoSe\textsubscript{2} exhibit deviations from the laser-field following of odd-order harmonics and crystal-mirror-plane following of even-order harmonics. We attribute these differences to the competing roles of the intraband and interband contributions, including the deflection of the electron-hole trajectories by nonparabolic crystal bands.},

As the conventional approach based on metallic emitters requires high operating temperatures the negative electron affinity (NEA) characteristic of diamond surfaces in conjunction with suitable donors would allow an electronic structure corresponding to a low effective work function. We have thus prepared phosphorus-doped polycrystalline diamond films on metallic substrates by plasma assisted chemical vapor deposition where an NEA surface characteristics was induced by exposure of the film surface to a hydrogen plasma. Thermionic electron emission measurements in an UHV environment were conducted with respect to the Richardson\textendash Dushman relation observing an emission current at temperatures {$<$}375~\textdegree C. Measurements were terminated at 765~\textdegree C without significant reduction in the electron emission current indicating a stable hydrogen passivation of the diamond surface. A fit of the emission data to the Richardson equation allowed for the extraction of emission parameters where the value of the materials work function was evaluated to 0.9~eV. This value could well be the lowest measured work function of any known material.},

Therefore, by a suitable combination of dispersion and quadratic phase modulation (now a "time lens"), we can synthesize the time-domain analog of an imaging system. Such a temporal-imaging system can magnify time waveforms in the same manner as conventional spatial-imaging systems magnify scenes. We analyze this space-time duality and derive expressions for the focal length and f-number of a time lens. In addition, the principles of temporal imaging are developed and we derive time-domain analogs for the imaging condition, magnification ratio, and impulse response of a temporal-imaging system.{$<>$}},

These alternative solutions can be eliminated by enforcing a sufficiently tight support constraint, or by introducing additional synthetic constraints. We furthermore propose a new DSI algorithm inspired by the analogy with coherent diffractive imaging (CDI) algorithms: the original DSI algorithm is in a way analogous to the hybrid input\textendash output algorithm as used in CDI, and we propose a new algorithm that is more analogous to the error reduction algorithm as used in CDI.

  abstract = {Atomic motion dynamics during structural changes or chemical reactions have been visualized by pico- and femtosecond pulsed electron beams via ultrafast electron diffraction and microscopy. Imaging the even faster dynamics of electrons in atoms, molecules, and solids requires electron pulses with subfemtosecond durations. We demonstrate here the all-optical generation of trains of attosecond free-electron pulses. The concept is based on the periodic energy modulation of a pulsed electron beam via an inelastic interaction, with the ponderomotive potential of an optical traveling wave generated by two femtosecond laser pulses at different frequencies in vacuum. The subsequent dispersive propagation leads to a compression of the electrons and the formation of ultrashort pulses. The longitudinal phase space evolution of the electrons after compression is mapped by a second phase-locked interaction. The comparison of measured and calculated spectrograms reveals the attosecond temporal structure of the compressed electron pulse trains with individual pulse durations of less than 300 as. This technique can be utilized for tailoring and initial characterization of suboptical-cycle free-electron pulses at high repetition rates for stroboscopic time-resolved experiments with subfemtosecond time resolution.},

ITO electrodes undergo substantial changes under high positive potentials (greater than 1.5 V vs. a saturated calomel electrode) in aqueous electrolytes. Longer potentiostatic stress leads to a decrease in the oxygen evolution reaction. The rate of this decrease increases with increasing electrode potential. Fluctuations of the current density are possible. It was found by a combination of radiochemical and electrochemical methods that the oxygen evolution is accompanied by electrode corrosion. After this process the electrode probably consists of an unchanged bulk and an SnO2 coating; its quasi-metallic character has disappeared.},

\par
an update, I think you were right about the nanoparticles being ITO reduced into indium and tin, I found a paper with SEM images of nanoparticles just like ours
\par
3:13
\par
here's theirs: [image]
\par
Donnie Keathley 3:13 PM
\par
Yep -- that also just makes the most sense right
\par
Emma Batson 3:13 PM
\par
yeah for sure
\par
3:14
\par
still reassuring to find it in the literature as well
\par
Donnie Keathley 3:14 PM
\par
Yeah, that paper I found they were a bit extended and not spherical right? However, that could be the exact conditions/exact type of solution or even sputtering conditions.
\par
Emma Batson 3:14 PM
\par
Right, it was also an "REM" image and I'm not really familiar with that technique
\par
Donnie Keathley 3:15 PM
\par
(raster electron micrograph -- I think it's simply an SEM to be honest)
\par
Emma Batson 3:15 PM
\par
ok I thought maybe that was the case but wasn't certain
\par
Donnie Keathley 3:16 PM
\par
I think then you have two solid results showing particle formation... In particular that first paper noted that it is likely the Chlorine
\par
Emma Batson 3:17 PM
\par
but yes now I'm looking more closely at the original paper and there were some differences, like they annealed their ITO at a much higher temperature so probably much more crystalline for instance
\par
Donnie Keathley 3:21 PM
\par
Note they claim that the particles are likely tin-oxide crystals as they argue indium goes into solution at a higher ate than the tin
\par
3:21
\par
(see Discussion and conclusions)... don't know if that was the takeaway from the other paper you found.
\par
Emma Batson 3:22 PM
\par
so the other paper didn't say that as clearly, but their data for the indium seemed a lot shakier to me than for the tin
\par
3:22
\par
so that checks out
\par
Donnie Keathley 3:24 PM
\par
Ah... now I'm reading again and it seems they tried two solutions, one of which was NaClO4 and the other was NaCl
\par
3:25
\par
They claim for NaCl indium and tin go into solution at the same rate, and the contacts were completely eroded in their measurements (last paragraph of sec. 3)...
\par
3:25
\par
Anyways -- those surfaces are getting rough either way.
\par
Emma Batson 3:26 PM
\par
Oh -- but they sent 3 volts through it, so maybe that's why it got eaten away so fast
\par
Donnie Keathley 3:27 PM
\par
Yeah
\par
3:28
\par
Mind sending that other paper to me?

  abstract = {The ability to imprint a phase pattern onto a coherent electron wave would find many applications in electron optics, in analogy to what is already possible with photons in light optics. Spatially dependent phase manipulation is achieved in transmission electron microscopy by passing the beam through a phase plate. However, in transmission mode this technique suffers from crystal imperfections and electron-matter interaction. If instead the electron wave is reflected of a spatially modulated potential, these difficulties can be circumvented. To demonstrate this principle, we consider here a periodic topological mirror structure that results in a sinusoidal plane of reflection for the incident electron. The reflection of the electron then takes place just above the physical mirror surface. Such ``electron grating mirror'' is expected to diffract the incident wave upon reflection by the introduced path length difference. The mirror can then be used as an electron beam splitter and coupler, analogous to semitransparent mirrors used in light optics. This enables for instance a lossless Mach-Zehnder interferometer for electrons. A numerical model that solves the Schr\"odinger equation for this system is obtained to enable a quantitative description of the grating mirror. The results show that the obtained diffraction order intensities behave like squared Bessel function of their respective order, and thus for instance the results show how an increase in grating pitch reduces the sensitivity to energy spread in the incident electron beam. Additionally, we show how the use of the WKB approximation enables faster calculations in the case of general patterns.},

Our experiment follows the recent theoretical investigations that determined two-color mid-infrared (IR) pulses, mixed with their third harmonic (\&\#x03C9; + 3\&\#x03C9;), to be close to optimal driving waveforms for enhancing HHG efficiency in the SXR region [Jin et al., Nature Comm. 5, 4003 (2014)]. We observed sub-optical-cycle-dependent efficiency enhancements of up to 8.2 of photon flux integrated between 20 \&\#x2013; 70 eV, and up to 2.2 between 85 \&\#x2013; 205 eV. Enhancement of HHG efficiency was most pronounced for the lowest tested backing pressure (\&\#x2248; 140 mbar), and decreased monotonically as the pressure was increased. The single-color (\&\#x03C9;)-driven HHG was optimal at the highest backing pressure tested in the experiment (\&\#x2248; 375 mbar). Our numerical simulations based on single-atom response and 3D pulse propagation show good qualitative agreement with experimental observations. The lower enhancement at high pressure and higher photon energy indicates that phase matching of two-color-driven HHG is more sensitive to ionization rate and pulse propagation effects than the single-color case. We show that with further improvements to the relative phase jitter and the spatio-temporal overlap of the two beams, the efficiency enhancement could be further improved by at least a factor of \&\#x2248; 2.},

  abstract = {Hypoxia, a condition of insufficient O2 to support metabolism, occurs when the vascular supply is interrupted, as in stroke or myocardial infarction, or when a tumor outgrows its vascular supply. When otherwise healthy tissues lose their O2 supply acutely, the cells usually die, whereas when cells gradually become hypoxic, they adapt by up-regulating the production of numerous proteins that promote their survival. These proteins slow the rate of growth, switch the mitochondria to glycolysis, stimulate growth of new vasculature, inhibit apoptosis, and promote metastatic spread. The consequence of these changes is that patients with hypoxic tumors invariably experience poor outcome to treatment. This has led the molecular imaging community to develop assays for hypoxia in patients, including regional measurements from O2 electrodes placed under CT guidance, several nuclear medicine approaches with imaging agents that accumulate with an inverse relationship to O2, MRI methods that measure either oxygenation directly or lactate production as a consequence of hypoxia, and optical methods with NIR and bioluminescence. The advantages and disadvantages of these approaches are reviewed, along with the individual strategies for validating different imaging methods. Ultimately the proof of value is in the clinical performance to predict outcome, select an appropriate cohort of patients to benefit from a hypoxia-directed treatment, or plan radiation fields that result in better local control. Hypoxia imaging in support of molecular medicine has become an important success story over the last decade and provides a model and some important lessons for development of new molecular imaging probes or techniques.},

Analytical solutions for field enhancement by spheroidal particles are used to provide physical insight for probe design. These solutions indicate that probes need to be not only sharp, but also finite in length in order to generate the highest field enhancement. Finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations of gold particles illuminated by near infrared radiation are performed. Field enhancements for right trigonal pyramids are found to be size and wavelength dependent. Furthermore, the enhancements for these pyramidal particles are higher than for similar length conical particles, which in turn perform better than quasi-infinite conical probes. The particles we design with FDTD can be made using current nanofabrication techniques, and therefore hold great promise as apertureless NSOM probes. These right trigonal pyramids are particularly well suited for use in tip enhanced nonlinear optical microscopy or near-field Raman microscopy. \textcopyright{} 2002 American Institute of Physics.},

  abstract = {This work is concerned with the first observation and investigation of electron recollision and attosecond dynamics in photoemission from a metal, specifically from a sharp metallic nanotip. Spectrally resolved measurements demonstrate electron rescattering, matter-wave interference effects and attosecond control of electron motion in few-cycle laser driven photoemission. As a first application, rescattered electrons were used as a probe to investigate nano-optical field enhancement effects at tips. In our experiment, 6-fs laser pulses from a Titanium:sapphire laser oscillator are focused on a sharp tungsten nanotip and induce electron emission. The optical field is strongly enhanced at the tip apex and allows for high local intensities on the order of 1013 W cm-2. Spectral measurements reveal above-threshold photoemission with clearly resolved multiphoton peaks. At increasing intensity we observe the suppression of the lowest order peak and a shift of the spectral peaks to lower energy. These effects are caused by the AC Stark shift and indicate that the strong-field photoemission regime has been reached in our system. Furthermore, we observe electron recollison and elastic rescattering. Photoelectrons are driven back to the tip surface by the laser field and recollide there. Elastic scattering takes place and leads to high kinetic energies, resulting in a plateau structure in photoelectron spectra. We present theory models that support this notion. Rescattered electrons are sensitive to the spatial and temporal shape of the enhanced nano-optical near-field at the tip. In a first application, we use rescattering to measure the strength of the near-field at tips of different size and material. The natural time scale of the rescattering process is the attosecond time scale. Carrierenvelope phase stable laser pulses are employed to study its temporal dynamics. Phaseresolved measurements show that the phase of the pulses determines the maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons and serves as an ultrafast switch for high-energy electrons. Moreover, the contrast of the peaks in the plateau is strongly modulated with the phase. This observation is the result of a matter-wave interference experiment: A temporal single slit or a double slit leads to absence or presence of spectral interference in the energy domain, respectively. In the case of a single slit, a broad spectral continuum results. The temporal shape of the pulse determines with attosecond precision if rescattered electrons are generated during one or two optical cycles. Our investigation shows that attosecond science \{ usually performed with atomic and molecular gases \{ can be extended to metal nanostructures.\vphantom{\}\}}},

The results are analysed in terms of a dynamic resonance of three photons with an AC Stark-shifted intermediate level (6s), followed by a saturated two-photon transition to the continuum. They demonstrate a linear relationship between detuning from the zero-field resonance position and the local momentary light intensity causing the five-photon ionisation. Thus, the AC Stark shift acts as a probe which selects a particular intensity from the wide range present in the laser focus. They determined the AC Stark shift of the 6s level the distribution function of the light intensities and the intensity dependence of the ionisation probability. High-resolution electron spectra are used in arguments to support the validity of their analysis.},

  abstract = {One of the astounding consequences of quantum mechanics is that it allows the detection of a target using an incident probe, with only a low probability of interaction of the probe and the target. This `quantum weirdness' could be applied in the field of electron microscopy to generate images of beam-sensitive specimens with substantially reduced damage to the specimen. A reduction of beam-induced damage to specimens is especially of great importance if it can enable imaging of biological specimens with atomic resolution. Following a recent suggestion that interaction-free measurements are possible with electrons, we now analyze the difficulties of actually building an atomic resolution interaction-free electron microscope, or ``quantum electron microscope''. A quantum electron microscope would require a number of unique components not found in conventional transmission electron microscopes. These components include a coherent electron beam-splitter or two-state-coupler, and a resonator structure to allow each electron to interrogate the specimen multiple times, thus supporting high success probabilities for interaction-free detection of the specimen. Different system designs are presented here, which are based on four different choices of two-state-couplers: a thin crystal, a grating mirror, a standing light wave and an electro-dynamical pseudopotential. Challenges for the detailed electron optical design are identified as future directions for development. While it is concluded that it should be possible to build an atomic resolution quantum electron microscope, we have also identified a number of hurdles to the development of such a microscope and further theoretical investigations that will be required to enable a complete interpretation of the images produced by such a microscope.},

  abstract = {We present an analysis of the beam dynamics in a Smith-Purcell free-electron laser (FEL). In this system, an electron beam interacts resonantly with a copropagating surface electromagnetic mode near the grating surface. The surface mode arises as a singularity in the frequency dependence of the reflection matrix. Since the surface mode is confined very close to the grating surface, the interaction is significant only if the electrons are moving very close to the grating surface. The group velocity of the surface mode resonantly interacting with a low-energy electron beam is in the direction opposite to the electron beam. The Smith-Purcell FEL is therefore a backward wave oscillator in which, if the beam current exceeds a certain threshold known as start current, the optical intensity grows to saturation even if no mirrors are employed for feedback. We derive the coupled Maxwell-Lorentz equations for describing the interaction between the surface mode and the electron beam, starting from the slowly varying approximation and the singularity in the reflection matrix. In the linear regime, we derive an analytic expression for the start current and calculate the growth rate of optical power in time. The analysis is extended to the nonlinear regime by performing a one-dimensional time-dependent numerical simulation. Results of our numerical calculation compare well with the analytic calculation in the linear regime and show saturation behavior in the nonlinear regime. We find that a significant amount of power grows in the surface mode due to this interaction. Several ways to outcouple this power to freely propagating modes are discussed.},

Optical solitons are a hallmark of extreme spatial or temporal confinement enabled by a variety of nonlinearities. Such particle-like structures can assemble in complex stable arrangements, forming "soliton molecules"[2,3]. Recent works revealed oscillatory internal motions of these bound states, akin to molecular vibrations[4-8]. These observations beg the question as to how far the "molecular" analogy reaches, whether further concepts from molecular spectroscopy apply in this scenario, and if such intra-molecular dynamics can be externally driven or manipulated. Here, we probe and control such ultrashort bound-states in an optical oscillator, utilizing real-time spectroscopy and time-dependent external perturbations. We introduce two-dimensional spectroscopy of the linear and nonlinear bound-state response and resolve anharmonicities in the soliton interaction leading to overtone and sub-harmonic generation. Employing a non-perturbative interaction, we demonstrate all-optical switching between distinct states with different binding separation, opening up novel schemes of ultrafast spectroscopy, optical logic operations and all-optical memory.},

Such fields are strong enough to compete with the Coulomb forces in controlling the electron dynamics in atomic systems. As a result, atoms in intense laser fields exhibit a variety of phenomena, which are collectively referred to as multiphoton processes. In this contribution we shall review the theory of one important process: the multiphoton ionization of atoms. We begin by giving a brief overview of some of the basic features of the multiphoton ionization. Experimental results will be used to illustrate these features. Next, we discuss some general issues concerning the study of the interaction of atoms with intense laser fields. In particular, we introduce the general form of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation to be solved and outline perturbation theory for laser-atom interactions. Two non-perturbative approaches for solving the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation, namely the use of Floquet theory and the direct numerical integration of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation, will then be considered. Subsequently, we outline approximation schemes for the low and high frequency regimes. Finally, we make some remarks concerning relativistic effects in intense laser-atom interactions.

Our experiment shows a less dramatic wavelength scaling of efficiency than the conventional case for near- and mid-IR driver wavelengths, and it is well explained by a generalized three-step model for increased Keldysh parameters that employs complex ionization times in addition to the nonadiabatic ionization. The complex ionization time is critical to avoid the divergence when replacing the quasistatic ionization model by the more general nonadiabatic ionization model. Together, the two modifications present a consistent description of the influence of the atomic potential on the rescattering process in the intermediate Keldysh regime.},

Once seeded with high harmonics, these schemes are considered as the next generation soft x-ray light sources delivering ultrashort pulses with high temporal and spatial coherence. Here, we present a detailed experimental study of a kHz two-colour high harmonic generation performed in various gases and investigate its potential as a suitable evolution of the actual seeding sources. It turns out that this double harmonic content source is highly tuneable, controllable and delivers intense radiation (measured here with a calibrated photodiode) with only one order of magnitude difference in the photon yield from 65 to 13 nm. Then, first and foremost, injections could be achieved at wavelengths shorter than what was previously accessible in FEL and PSXL and/or additional energy could be extracted. Also, such a strong and handy seed could allow the saturation range of FEL devices to be greatly extended to shorter wavelengths and would bring higher spectral as well as intensity stabilities in this spectral zone.},

The main theoretical contenders, such as the Buttiker\textendash Landauer, Eisenbud\textendash Wigner, and Larmor time, give contradictory answers. On the other hand, recent attempts at reconstructing valence electron dynamics in atoms and molecules have entered a regime where the tunneling time genuinely matters. Here, we compare the main competing theories of tunneling time against experimental measurements using the attoclock in strong laser field ionization of helium atoms. The attoclock uses a close to circularly polarized femtosecond laser pulse, mapping the angle of rotation of the laser field vector to time similar to the hand of a watch. Refined attoclock measurements reveal a real (not instantaneous) tunneling delay time over a large intensity regime, using two independent experimental apparatus. Only two theoretical predictions are compatible within our experimental error: the Larmor time and the probability distribution of tunneling times constructed using a Feynman Path Integral formulation. The latter better matches the observed qualitative change in tunneling time over a wide intensity range, and predicts a broad tunneling time distribution with a long tail. The implication of such a probability distribution of tunneling times, as opposed to a distinct tunneling time, would imply that one must account for a significant, though bounded and measurable, uncertainty as to when the hole dynamics begin to evolve. We therefore expect our results to impact the reconstruction of attosecond electron dynamics following tunnel ionization.},

Cryo X-ray tomography is a new imaging technique that generates three-dimensional (3-D) information of whole cells. In the energy range of X-rays used to examine cells, organic material absorbs approximately an order of magnitude more strongly than water. This produces a quantifiable natural contrast in fully hydrated cells and eliminates the need for chemical fixatives or contrast enhancement reagents to visualize cellular structures. Because proteins can be localized in the X-ray microscope using immunogold labeling protocols (Meyer-Ilse et al., 2001. J. Microsc. 201, 395\textendash 403), tomography enables 3-D molecular localization. The time required to collect the data for each cell shown here was {$<$}15 min and has recently been reduced to 3 min, making it possible to examine numerous yeast and to collect statistically significant high-resolution data. In this video essay, we show examples of 3-D tomographic reconstructions of whole yeast and demonstrate the power of this technology to obtain quantifiable information from whole, hydrated cells.},

The method relies on the conversion of the attosecond pulse into electron wave-packets through photoionization of atoms in the presence of a weak IR field. It allows for the unique determination of the spectral phase making up the pulses by accurately taking into account the atomic physics of the photoionization process. The phases are evaluated by optimizing the fit of a perturbation theory calculation to the experimental result. The method has been called iPROOF (improved Phase Retrieval by Omega Oscillation Filtering) as it bears a similarity to the PROOF technique [Chini et al. Opt. Express 18, 13006 (2010)]. The procedure has been demonstrated for the characterization of an attosecond pulse train composed of odd and even harmonics. We observe a large phase shift between consecutive odd and even harmonics. The resulting attosecond pulse train has a complex structure not resembling a single attosecond pulse once per IR period, which is the case for zero phase. Finally, the retrieval procedure can be applied to the characterization of single attosecond pulses as well.},

Adv. 4, eaao5207 (2018)]. Understanding the high-harmonic response of few-layer semiconducting systems is important and might open up possible technological applications. Using extensive first-principles calculations within a time-dependent density functional theory framework, we show how the in-plane and out-of-plane nonlinear nonperturbative responses of two-dimensional materials evolve from the monolayer to the bulk. We illustrate this phenomenon for the case of multilayer hexagonal BN layered systems. Whereas the in-plane HHG is found not to be strongly altered by the stacking of the layers, we found that the out-of-plane response is strongly affected by the number of layers considered. This is explained by the interplay between the induced electric field, resulting from the electron-electron interaction, and the interlayer delocalization of the wave functions contributing most to the HHG signal. The gliding of a bilayer is also found to affect the high-harmonic emission. Our results will have important ramifications for the experimental study of monolayer and few-layer two-dimensional materials beyond the case of hexagonal BN studied here as the results we found are generic and applicable to all two-dimensional semiconducting multilayer systems.},

A high uniform degree of mutual coherence {$\gamma$}d, larger than 0.5 in most cases, is measured as a function of the position of the jet relative to the focus, and pressure in the jet. It confirms the high intrinsic spatial coherence already reported for the extreme-ultraviolet harmonics, which is much larger than the one produced from x-ray lasers. Spatial coherence decreases when the laser focus is moved toward the jet, and when the pressure is increased: the onset of ionization, as well as the intensity-dependent phase of the nonlinear polarization, are rapidly varying factors in time and space which degrade the correlation between the fields at two different points. Simulation of the coherence degree emphasizes the role of the intensity-dependent phase in the evolution of the coherence degree.},

Further utilization of plasmonic nanoaperture requires the broadband tuning of the operating wavelength and precise control of aperture geometry. Here, we present a novel plasmonic coaxial aperture that can support resonant extraordinary optical transmission (EOT) with a peak transmittance of \textasciitilde 10\% and a wide tuning range over a few hundred nanometers. Because of the shadow deposition process, we could precisely control the gap size of the coaxial aperture down to the sub\textendash 10-nm scale. The plasmonic resonance of the SiN\textsubscript{x}/Au disk at the center of the coaxial aperture efficiently funnels the incident light into the sub\textendash 10-nm gap and allows strong electric field confinement for efficient second harmonic generation (SHG), as well as EOT. In addition to the experiment, we theoretically investigated the modal properties of the plasmonic coaxial aperture depending on the structural parameters and correlation between EOT and SHG through finite-difference time-domain simulations. We believe that our plasmonic coaxial apertures, which are readily fabricated by the nanoimprinting process, can be a versatile, practical platform for enhanced light\textendash matter interaction and its nonlinear optical applications.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {A novel optical holographic technique is presented to simultaneously measure both the real and imaginary components of the complex refractive index (CRI) of a protein solution over a wide visible wavelength range. Quantitative phase imaging was employed to precisely measure the optical field transmitted from a protein solution, from which the CRIs of the protein solution were retrieved using the Fourier light scattering technique. Using this method, we characterized the CRIs of the two dominant structural states of a photoactive yellow protein solution over a broad wavelength range (461\textendash 582\,nm). The significant CRI deviation between the two structural states was quantified and analysed. The results of both states show the similar overall shape of the expected rRI obtained from the~Kramers\textendash Kronig relations.},

  abstract = {Singlet exciton fission, a process that generates two excitons from a single photon, is perhaps the most efficient of the various multiexciton-generation processes studied to date, offering the potential to increase the efficiency of solar devices. But its unique characteristic, splitting a photogenerated singlet exciton into two dark triplet states, means that the empty absorption region between the singlet and triplet excitons must be filled by adding another material that captures low-energy photons. This has required the development of specialized device architectures.In this Account, we review work to develop devices that harness the theoretical benefits of singlet exciton fission. First, we discuss singlet fission in the archetypal material, pentacene. Pentacene-based photovoltaic devices typically show high external and internal quantum efficiencies. They have enabled researchers to characterize fission, including yield and the impact of competing loss processes, within functional devices. We review in situ probes of singlet fission that modulate the photocurrent using a magnetic field. We also summarize studies of the dissociation of triplet excitons into charge at the pentacene\textendash buckyball (C60) donor\textendash acceptor interface. Multiple independent measurements confirm that pentacene triplet excitons can dissociate at the C60 interface despite their relatively low energy.Because triplet excitons produced by singlet fission each have no more than half the energy of the original photoexcitation, they limit the potential open circuit voltage within a solar cell. Thus, if singlet fission is to increase the overall efficiency of a solar cell and not just double the photocurrent at the cost of halving the voltage, it is necessary to also harvest photons in the absorption gap between the singlet and triplet energies of the singlet fission material. We review two device architectures that attempt this using long-wavelength materials: a three-layer structure that uses long- and short-wavelength donors and an acceptor and a simpler, two-layer combination of a singlet-fission donor and a long-wavelength acceptor. An example of the trilayer structure is singlet fission in tetracene with copper phthalocyanine inserted at the C60 interface. The bilayer approach includes pentacene photovoltaic cells with an acceptor of infrared-absorbing lead sulfide or lead selenide nanocrystals. Lead selenide nanocrystals appear to be the most promising acceptors, exhibiting efficient triplet exciton dissociation and high power conversion efficiency.Finally, we review architectures that use singlet fission materials to sensitize other absorbers, thereby effectively converting conventional donor materials to singlet fission dyes. In these devices, photoexcitation occurs in a particular molecule and then energy is transferred to a singlet fission dye where the fission occurs. For example, rubrene inserted between a donor and an acceptor decouples the ability to perform singlet fission from other major photovoltaic properties such as light absorption.},

Ultrashort (100 fs, 800 nm) laser pulses of a Ti-Sapphire laser resonantly excite electron emission from a few tens of nanometer wide-gap regions of the array. We investigated the near-field enhanced photoemission using time-of-flight momentum microscopy. The variation of the electron emission intensity as a function of kinetic energy, parallel momentum, power density, and polarization of the laser beam reveals two distinct emission mechanisms: a coherent multiphoton photoemission process from the optically heated electron gas and a field emission process resulting from the optical near-field enhancement at the nanoantenna tips. The analysis of the momentum-resolved kinetic energy spectra indicates a spatially inhomogeneous distribution of the electron gas temperature within the bow-tie resonators.},

This was achieved by using the process of high-harmonic generation in atoms4,5, in which the photons of a driving laser pulse of infrared frequency are upconverted into photons of higher frequencies in the extreme ultraviolet spectral range. The quantum state of the fundamental mode after the interaction, when conditioned on the high-harmonic generation, is a so-called Schr\"odinger cat state, which corresponds to a superposition of two distinct coherent states: the initial state of the laser and the coherent state reduced in amplitude that results from the interaction with atoms. The results open the path for investigations towards the control of the non-classical states, exploiting conditioning approaches on physical processes relevant to high-harmonic generation.},

  abstract = {The motion of electrons in the microcosm occurs on a time scale set by the atomic unit of time\textemdash 24 attoseconds. Attosecond pulses at photon energies corresponding to the fundamental absorption edges of matter, which lie in the soft X-ray regime above 200\,eV, permit the probing of electronic excitation, chemical state, and atomic structure. Here we demonstrate a soft X-ray pulse duration of 53 as and single pulse streaking reaching the carbon K-absorption edge (284\,eV) by utilizing intense two-cycle driving pulses near 1.8-{$\mu$}m center wavelength. Such pulses permit studies of electron dynamics in live biological samples and next-generation electronic materials such as diamond., Isolated attosecond pulses are produced using high harmonic generation and sources of these pulses often suffer from low photon flux in soft X-ray regime. Here the authors demonstrate efficient generation and characterization of 53 as pulses with photon energy near the water window.},

We find that total decay rates and surface plasmon polariton channel decay rates orders of magnitude larger than those characteristic of metallic nanofilms alone can be achieved in ultrastrong hot spots of gap plasmons. For the requirement of practical applications, propagating single photons with decay rates of 290{$\gamma$}0\textendash 770{$\gamma$}0 are guided into the phase-matched low-loss nanofibers.

Field-emitted electrons from VA-CNFs are accelerated to high energy and subsequently collide with neutral gas molecules, leading to ionization/fragmentation of the molecules. Double-gated field-emitter arrays with isolated VA-CNF tips were fabricated using a photoresist planarization technique. Two types of devices were fabricated and characterized. The first type of device has the emitter tip in the same plane as the extraction gate, and the second type of device has the emitter tip 900 nm below the extraction gate. All devices were made using a process that results in gate and focus diameters of 1.7 and 4.2 {$\mu$}m, respectively. When operated as a field-emitted electron impact ionizer (EII), for the same ion current, the ionization efficiency (ratio of ions to emitted electrons) increased from 0.005 to 0.05 as the pressure is increased between 5\texttimes 10-6 and 1\texttimes 10-3 torr.

At the mid-infrared wavelength, the Keldysh parameter could be much smaller than unity even at relatively modest laser intensities, enabling the study of the strong-field sub-cycle electron dynamics in solids without damage. Here we report a high-energy sub-cycle pulse synthesiser based on a mid-infrared optical parametric amplifier and its application to high-harmonic generation in solids. The signal and idler combined spectrum spans from 2.5 to 9.0\,\textmu m. We coherently synthesise the passively carrier-envelope phase-stable signal and idler pulses to generate 33\,{$\mu$}J, 0.88-cycle, multi-gigawatt pulses centred at \textasciitilde 4.2\,{$\mu$}m, which is further energy scalable. The mid-infrared sub-cycle pulse is used for driving high-harmonic generation in thin silicon samples, producing harmonics up to \textasciitilde 19th order with a continuous spectral coverage due to the isolated emission by the sub-cycle driver. Stable sub-cycle pulses in the mid-infrared region allow damage-free investigation of electron dynamics in solids. Here, the authors develop a suitable source to this end which is based on an optical parametric amplifier.},

This wide-line-spacing comb, or `astro-comb', is well matched to the resolving power of high-resolution astrophysical spectrographs.

  abstract = {Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are advertised as environmentally friendly because they are energy efficient and mercury-free. This study aimed to determine if LEDs engender other forms of environmental and human health impacts, and to characterize variation across different LEDs based on color and intensity. The objectives are as follows: (i) to use standardized leachability tests to examine whether LEDs are to be categorized as hazardous waste under existing United States federal and California state regulations; and (ii) to use material life cycle impact and hazard assessment methods to evaluate resource depletion and toxicity potentials of LEDs based on their metallic constituents. According to federal standards, LEDs are not hazardous except for low-intensity red LEDs, which leached Pb at levels exceeding regulatory limits (186 mg/L; regulatory limit: 5). However, according to California regulations, excessive levels of copper (up to 3892 mg/kg; limit: 2500), Pb (up to 8103 mg/kg; limit: 1000), nickel (up to 4797 mg/kg; limit: 2000), or silver (up to 721 mg/kg; limit: 500) render all except low-intensity yellow LEDs hazardous. The environmental burden associated with resource depletion potentials derives primarily from gold and silver, whereas the burden from toxicity potentials is associated primarily with arsenic, copper, nickel, lead, iron, and silver. Establishing benchmark levels of these substances can help manufacturers implement design for environment through informed materials substitution, can motivate recyclers and waste management teams to recognize resource value and occupational hazards, and can inform policymakers who establish waste management policies for LEDs.},

  abstract = {Gold nanorods have been found to change their shape after excitation with intense pulsed laser irradiation. The final irradiation products strongly depend on the energy of the laser pulse as well as on its width. We performed a series of measurements in which the excitation power was varied over the range of the output power of an amplified femtosecond laser system producing pulses of 100 fs duration and a nanosecond optical parametric oscillator (OPO) laser system having a pulse width of 7 ns. The shape transformations of the gold nanorods are followed by two techniques:? (1) visible absorption spectroscopy by monitoring the changes in the plasmon absorption bands characteristic for gold nanoparticles; (2) transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in order to analyze the final shape and size distribution. While at high laser fluences (?1 J cm-2) the gold nanoparticles fragment, a melting of the nanorods into spherical nanoparticles (nanodots) is observed when the laser energy is lowered. Upon decreasing the energy of the excitation pulse, only partial melting of the nanorods takes place. Shorter but wider nanorods are observed in the final distribution as well as a higher abundance of particles having odd shapes (bent, twisted, {$\varphi$}-shaped, etc.). The threshold for complete melting of the nanorods with femtosecond laser pulses is about 0.01 J cm-2. Comparing the results obtained using the two different types of excitation sources (femtosecond vs nanosecond laser), it is found that the energy threshold for a complete melting of the nanorods into nanodots is about 2 orders of magnitude higher when using nanosecond laser pulses than with femtosecond laser pulses. This is explained in terms of the successful competitive cooling process of the nanorods when the nanosecond laser pulses are used. For nanosecond pulse excitation, the absorption of the nanorods decreases during the laser pulse because of the bleaching of the longitudinal plasmon band. In addition, the cooling of the lattice occurring on the 100 ps time scale can effectively compete with the rate of absorption in the case of the nanosecond pulse excitation but not for the femtosecond pulse excitation. When the excitation source is a femtosecond laser pulse, the involved processes (absorption of the photons by the electrons (100 fs), heat transfer between the hot electrons and the lattice ({$<$}10 ps), melting (30 ps), and heat loss to the surrounding solvent ({$>$}100 ps) are clearly separated in time.},

  abstract = {Photovoltaic devices have great potential in harvesting solar energy. In organic solar cells, the role of the donor\textendash acceptor heterojunction is critically important; here optical excitation leads to charge separation (CS) and subsequently photocurrent generation. Charge recombination (CR) may also happen, which reduces the overall efficiency of the device. After light absorption, the singlet excitation of a pentacene can achieve CS at the interface, or it may also undergo singlet fission and produce two triplet excitons, which may further undergo CS at the interface. In this work, we study charge-transfer processes at the pentacene\textendash C60 interface, including CS rates in both singlet and triplet surfaces, and the CR rate back to the ground state. We first constructed two different pentacene\textendash C60 interfacial structures by force field optimization. With pentacene\textendash C60 molecular pairs derived from the structures, we calculate the electronic couplings of CS and CR reactions. We found that the electron-transfer couplings have a systematic preference on the configurations. Both singlet and triplet CS coupling prefer to take place in the ``head-on'' configurations, where the C60 is located at the top of the pentacene, whereas CR coupling prefers the ``inserted'' configuration, where the pentacene is located between two C60 and is slightly lifted from the layer. In estimating the electron-transfer rates, we found that the interfacial energy shift has a determining effect. When an interfacial energy derived from experimental results is included, we found that the calculated triplet CS rate can reach 1013 s\textendash 1, while the singlet CS rate is only {$\sim$}105 s\textendash 1. The CR rate was calculated to be 1011 s\textendash 1 for a singlet ion pair. Our results indicate that triplet CS is fast. Because triplet CS can proceed after singlet fission, with its immediate recombination being spin-forbidden, it is important to photovoltaic performance in the pentacene\textendash C60 system.},

  abstract = {Two substrates, Si and ZnO film-coated Si (ZnOf/Si), were used to investigate growth behavior and microstructure evolution of single-crystal ZnO nanorods (ZNs) in aqueous solutions at low temperatures. It was found that those ZNs present different growth behavior and characterization. On pure Si substrate, ZNs were scattered over the entire Si substrate with a preferred orientation in the (1 0 0) plane or grown along the direction. HRTEM observation demonstrates that the scattered ZNs exhibit a two-stage growth mechanism with a self-assembly process of ZNs in the later growth stage. In contrast, on ZnOf/Si, well-aligned ZNs were directly nucleated from ZnO film on Si and grown along the [0 0 0 2] direction. In comparison with the scattered ZNs, a larger aspect ratio (length/width) up to 25-30 was obtained for the well-aligned ZNs. In addition, some planar defects such as stacking faults probably resulted due to faster stacking of a ZnO growth unit in the later growth stage. These observations and findings imply that the growth of the well-aligned ZNs from the solution is not related to the used substrates but strongly influenced by the surface treatment and characteristics on the substrate.},

Here we report enhanced non-perturbative high-harmonic emission from a Fano-resonant Si metasurface that possesses a classical analogue of electromagnetically induced transparency. The harmonic emission is enhanced by more than two orders of magnitude compared to unpatterned samples. The enhanced high harmonics are highly anisotropic with respect to the excitation polarization and are selective by the excitation wavelength due to its resonant features. By combining nanofabrication technology and ultrafast strong-field physics, our work paves the way for the design of new compact ultrafast photonic devices that operate under high intensities and at short wavelengths.},

Complete characterization of optical waveforms, however, requires an optical oscilloscope capable of resolving the electric field oscillations with sub-femtosecond resolution and with single-shot operation. Here, we show that strong-field nonlinear excitation of photocurrents in a silicon-based image sensor chip can provide the sub-cycle optical gate necessary to characterize carrier-envelope phase-stable optical waveforms in the mid-infrared.

However, complete characterization of optical waveforms requires an `optical oscilloscope' capable of resolving the electric-field oscillations with sub-femtosecond resolution and with single-shot operation. Here we show that strong-field nonlinear excitation of photocurrents in a silicon-based image sensor chip can provide the sub-cycle optical gate necessary to characterize carrier-envelope phase-stable optical waveforms in the mid-infrared. By mapping the temporal delay between an intense excitation and weak perturbing pulse onto a transverse spatial coordinate of the image sensor, we show that the technique allows single-shot measurement of few-cycle waveforms.},

  title = {Complementary {{Aluminum}} Nanopatch / Nanohole Arrays for Broad Palettes of Colors},
  author = {Lochbihler, Hans and Ye, Yan and Xu, Yishen},
  abstract = {We investigate aluminum nanopatch/nanohole arrays surrounded by a dielectric material on plastic substrates for large area color printing. In this specific arrangement, metallic nanopatches have a smaller size than that of the  anoholes, lying distantly above their complementary nanoholes. Simulation results show that the coloring in reflection as well as in transmission can be tuned greatly by the structure period and the duty cycle. In contrast, variations of the separation distance practically do not change the hue. Manufactured samples having a large range of these grating parameters demonstrate a broad palette of bright colors in reflection and transmission. The fabrication process may be scaled up for large area color printing, since it can be implemented as a cost-effective roll-to-roll process.},
  note = {\textbf{Review}
\par
In this work, "Complementary Aluminum nanopatch / nanohole arrays for broad palettes of colors", the authors present a thorough study of the use of plasmonic aluminum nanostructures for color printing applications.~ Since the fabrication process can utilize nano-imprint techniques and roll-to-roll processing, it has the potential for use in large-scale printing applications.
\par
The authors present a thorough study of most all major aspect of their square aluminum arrays, including period, duty cycle, and pillar height, and observe how each impact the perceived color.~ Beyond simulation, the authors also fabricate working samples.~ While the simulations use a simplification of the structure, the results seem to fit well with experimental data.~
\par
While the results are promising and convincing, I have the following major critiques to this work regarding presentation that I feel should be addressed.
\par
\begin{enumerate}

\item In ref. 17, a very similar structure is investigated both experimentally and theoretically.~ In the introduction, I feel this reference, as well as the other references to color printing with plasmonic structures, should be discussed in more detail to give more context to your work. What have others observed, and, more importantly, what is the key thing that you observe/improve upon here? What is the value added to me by reading your paper I don't get form the others?~ This should be made very explicit.

\item Your paper has a lot of results, but not much discussion in terms of guidance for those wanting to use this method. Why should I pick it over others techniques?~ What do I learn from this paper that has not been already discussed in ref. 17 or others that you mention? There should be more guidance in the discussion of the simulation and experimental results.

\item I think the color gamut produceable with these structures should be discussed.~ Can every color be reproduced?~ Are there limitations to reproducing certain colors?~ Solutions to this if not?

\end{enumerate}

\par
If the above critiques can be adequately addressed, I feel the work can be published.
\par
\textbf{Minor Points}
\par
\begin{enumerate}

\item You often say "separated distantly".~ This is too vague.~ Give a scale and/or range to give the reader context of what you mean by distant.

\item It should be more explicit that the emitters are assumed perfect squares here.

\item In Fig. 1, please relabel in a more clear fashion (for instance left-to-right then top-to-bottom). It is confusing that (d) is in the top-right.

\item For all of your pseudocolor plots, the color scale is very confusing.~ To me the purple appears high in value, but it is actually zero.~ Could this be changed to make it clearer where there is a maximum/minimum?

\item In the caption of Fig. 1 and in general in the text, please just give the value for w1 or whatever parameter shown as a number rather than an equation.~ You specify the equation at some point, so it is known it is fixed by the relation, but there should be a number there.

\item Equations: please use journal guidelines... the equations now appear to be in plain text and don't appear to be properly formatted.

\item Two paragraphs under fig. 1 you discuss the trapezoidal shape of the pillar.~ This would be best put in a schematic somewhere.

\item For simulations, specify polarization of incoming light.

\item Check that there is always a space between number and unit (e.g. 200 nm not 200nm)

\item In general, you specify all parameters that were held fixed when varying one, however I note that you often don't specify duty cycle.~ While I realize it can be calculated, you later focus on duty cycle as an important parameter, so it would be helpful to explicitly state it.

\item Fig. 5 is missing labels to scale bars, and the scale bars should be more visible.

\item In the paragraph under fig. 5, what is crucial about this step?~ Perhaps you are looking for another word?

\item At the end of the manuscript, there is a sentence that needs edited: "Moreover, the verify the beforehand simulated results." I think the should be they.

\item In general there are a few spots where the descriptions/wording could be improved by letting a native english speaker look over the manuscript.

\item Why did you use a thickness of 40 nm and not adjust this parameter?

  note = {The concept of the photon, central to Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect, is exactly 100 years old. Yet, while photons have been detected individually for more than 50 years, devices producing individual photons on demand have only appeared in the last few years. New concepts for single-photon sources, or `photon guns', have originated from recent progress in the optical detection, characterization and manipulation of single quantum objects. Single emitters usually deliver photons one at a time. This so-called antibunching of emitted photons can arise from various mechanisms, but ensures that the probability of obtaining two or more photons at the same time remains negligible. We briefly recall basic concepts in quantum optics and discuss potential applications of single-photon states to optical processing of quantum information: cryptography, computing and communication. A photon gun's properties are significantly improved by coupling it to a resonant cavity mode, either in the Purcell or strong-coupling regimes. We briefly recall early production of single photons with atomic beams, and the operation principles of macroscopic parametric sources, which are used in an overwhelming majority of quantum-optical experiments. We then review the photophysical and spectroscopic properties and compare the advantages and weaknesses of various single nanometre-scale objects used as single-photon sources: atoms or ions in the gas phase and, in condensed matter, organic molecules, defect centres, semiconductor nanocrystals and heterostructures. As new generations of sources are developed, coupling to cavities and nano-fabrication techniques lead to improved characteristics, delivery rates and spectral ranges. Judging from the brisk pace of recent progress, we expect single photons to soon proceed from demonstrations to applications and to bring with them the first practical uses of quantum information.}

  abstract = {The electro-optical properties of most semiconductors and insulators of technological interest are dominated by the presence of electron-hole quasiparticles called excitons. The manipulation of these hydrogen-like quasi-particles in dielectrics, has received great interest under the name excitonics that is expected to be of great potential for a variety of applications, including optoelectronics and photonics. A crucial step for such exploitation of excitons in advanced technological applications is a detailed understanding of their dynamical nature. However, the ultrafast processes unfolding on few-femtosecond and attosecond time scales, of primary relevance in view of the desired extension of electronic devices towards the petahertz regime, remain largely unexplored. Here we apply attosecond transient reflection spectroscopy in a sequential two-foci geometry and observe sub-femtosecond dynamics of a core-level exciton in bulk MgF\$\_2\$ single crystals. With our unique setup, we can access absolute phase delays which allow for an unambiguous comparison with theoretical calculations based on the Wannier-Mott model. Our results show that excitons surprisingly exhibit a dual atomic- and solid-like character which manifests itself on different time scales. While the former is responsible for a femtosecond optical Stark effect, the latter dominates the attosecond excitonic response and originates by the interaction with the crystal. Further investigation of the role of exciton localization proves that the bulk character persists also for strongly localised quasi-particles and allows us to envision a new route to control exciton dynamics in the close-to-petahertz regime.},

  abstract = {High\textendash harmonic generation (HHG) in gases has been the main enabling technology of attosecond science since its discovery. Recently, HHG from solids has been demonstrated, opening a lively area of research. In contrast, harmonic generation from liquids has so far remained restricted to low harmonics in the visible regime. Here, we report the observation and detailed characterization of extreme ultraviolet HHG from liquid water and several alcohols extending beyond 20\,eV. This advance was enabled by the implementation of the recent liquid flat\textendash microjet technology, which we show to facilitate the spatial separation of HHG from the bulk liquid and the surrounding gas phase. We observe striking differences between the HHG spectra of water and several alcohols. A comparison with a strongly\textendash driven few\textendash band model establishes the sensitivity of HHG to the electronic structure of liquids. Our results suggest liquid\textendash phase high\textendash harmonic spectroscopy as a new method for studying the electronic structure and ultrafast scattering processes in liquids.},

  abstract = {Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) high-harmonic radiation emerging from laser-driven atoms, molecules or plasmas underlies powerful attosecond spectroscopy techniques and provides insight into fundamental structural and dynamic properties of matter. The advancement of these spectroscopy techniques to study strong-field electron dynamics in condensed matter calls for the generation and manipulation of EUV radiation in bulk solids, but this capability has remained beyond the reach of optical sciences. Recent experiments and theoretical predictions paved the way to strong-field physics in solids by demonstrating the generation and optical control of deep ultraviolet radiation in bulk semiconductors, driven by femtosecond mid-infrared fields or the coherent up-conversion of terahertz fields to multi-octave spectra in the mid-infrared and optical frequencies. Here we demonstrate that thin films of SiO2 exposed to intense, few-cycle to sub-cycle pulses give rise to wideband coherent EUV radiation extending in energy to about 40 electronvolts. Our study indicates the association of the emitted EUV radiation with intraband currents of multi-petahertz frequency, induced in the lowest conduction band of SiO2. To demonstrate the applicability of high-harmonic spectroscopy to solids, we exploit the EUV spectra to gain access to fine details of the energy dispersion profile of the conduction band that are as yet inaccessible by photoemission spectroscopy in wide-bandgap dielectrics. In addition, we use the EUV spectra to trace the attosecond control of the intraband electron motion induced by synthesized optical transients. Our work advances lightwave electronics in condensed matter into the realm of multi-petahertz frequencies and their attosecond control, and marks the advent of solid-state EUV photonics.},

In this work, we report polarimetry of high-harmonic emission from solids and exploit this novel capability to directly retrieve the Berry curvature of {$\alpha$}-quartz. We show that the two manifestations of broken inversion symmetry in solids lead to perpendicular or parallel polarization of even harmonics with respect to the driving field. Using semiclassical transport theory, we retrieve the Berry curvature from spectra measured in perpendicular polarization, the results being supported by ab initio calculation. Our work demonstrates an approach for the direct measurement of Berry curvature in solids, which could serve as a benchmark for theoretical studies.},

At intensities exceeding 1019 W cm-2 on target, i.e., in the strongly relativistic regime of electron dynamics, multi-megaelectronvolt electrons are accelerated by the SP field as dense bunches collimated in a near-tangent direction. By the use of a suitable blazed grating, the bunch charge can be increased up to {$\approx$}660 pC. Intense extreme ultraviolet high harmonics (HHs) diffracted by the grating are observed when a plasma with a submicrometer scale is produced at the target surface by a controlled prepulse. When the SP is excited, the HHs are strongly enhanced in a direction quasi-parallel to the electrons. Simulations suggest that the HHs are boosted by nanobunching in the SP field of the electrons which scatter the laser field. Besides the static and dynamic tailoring of the target density profile, further control of electron and HH emission might be achieved by changing the SP duration using a laser pulse with a rotating wavefront. The latter technique may allow the production of nearly single-cycle SPs.},

Entanglement in this degree of freedom often manifests itself on ultrafast time scales, making it very difficult to detect, whether one employs direct or interferometric techniques, as photon-counting detectors have insufficient time resolution. Here, we implement ultrafast photon counters based on nonlinear interactions and strong femtosecond laser pulses to probe energy-time entanglement in this important regime. Using this technique and single-photon spectrometers, we characterize all the spectral and temporal correlations of two entangled photons with femtosecond resolution. This enables the witnessing of energy-time entanglement using uncertainty relations and the direct observation of nonlocal dispersion cancellation on ultrafast time scales. These techniques are essential to understand and control the energy-time degree of freedom of light for ultrafast quantum optics.},

It is demonstrated that the substrate pre-treatment conditions such as the concentration of the ZnO colloid, spin coating times, and substrate annealing treatment have their respective influence on controlling the density of the ZNAs. The introduction of a ZnO nanoparticle layer on the substrate not only helps to control the nanorod density but also has a strong impact on the orientation of the nanorod arrays. Although controlling the spin coating process has a similar mechanism to controlling the concentration of colloid, it offers a convenient method to prepare a series of ZNAs with variable density. An annealing treatment of the substrate can influence the microstructure of the ZnO seed layer and then influence the density of the ZNAs.}

  abstract = {Growth of vertically aligned ZnO nanowire arrays has been extensively studied on a variety of important semiconductor substrates, such as SiC and GaN. Systematic experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of growth parameters to the quality of the nanowires. In addition, the growth of nanowalls connecting individual aligned nanowires was studied and a growth mechanism was proposed. These conductive and interconnected nanowalls are indispensable for nanodevices to be fabricated on nonconductive substrates for serving as a common electrode. Finally, these nanowire arrays have been integrated as ultra violet detectors, which show good optical performance.}

  abstract = {One challenge existing since the invention of electron-beam lithography (EBL) is understanding the exposure mechanisms that limit the resolution of EBL. To overcome this challenge, we need to understand the spatial distribution of energy density deposited in the resist, that is, the point-spread function (PSF). During EBL exposure, the processes of electron scattering, phonon, photon, plasmon, and electron emission in the resist are combined, which complicates the analysis of the EBL PSF. Here, we show the measurement of delocalized energy transfer in EBL exposure by using chromatic aberration-corrected energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM) at the sub-10 nm scale. We have defined the role of spot size, electron scattering, secondary electrons, and volume plasmons in the lithographic PSF by performing EFTEM, momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), sub-10 nm EBL, and Monte Carlo simulations. We expect that these results will enable alternative ways to improve the resolution limit of EBL. Furthermore, our approach to study the resolution limits of EBL may be applied to other lithographic techniques where electrons also play a key role in resist exposure, such as ion-beam-, X-ray-, and extreme-ultraviolet lithography.},

The improvement will enable electron microscopes and diffraction cameras to better resolve the dynamics of reactions in the areas of solid state physics, chemistry, and biology. The design utilizes a combination of mirror optics and a magnetic beam separator, which exploits the symmetry inherent in reversing the electron trajectory in the mirror in order to compress the pulse. This system can also simultaneously correct the spherical and chromatic aberration of the objective lens for improved spatial resolution. For pulsed experiments with a practical bunch charge, the correction of the chromatic aberration coefficient counters the spread in the electron energies induced by the space charge of the pulse to make possible the probing of the sample with high spatial resolution. The pulse compressor can accommodate pulses with a range of electron densities and energy spreads. Furthermore, it is designed to fit into both ultrafast electron diffraction cameras and dynamic/ultrafast transmission electron microscopes. Consequently, this instrument is suitable for enhancing the study of the structure, composition, and bonding states of new materials at ultrafast time scales.},

The two key ingredients for sub-cycle pulse generation are bandwidths substantially exceeding one octave and accurate control of the spectral phase. These requirements are very challenging to satisfy with a single laser beam, and thus intense research activity is currently devoted to the coherent synthesis of pulses generated by separate sources. In this review we discuss the conceptual schemes and experimental tools that can be employed for the generation, amplification, control, and combination of separate light pulses. The main techniques for the spectrotemporal characterization of the synthesized fields are also described. We discuss recent implementations of coherent waveform synthesis: from the first demonstration of a single-cycle optical pulse by the addition of two pulse trains derived from a fiber laser, to the coherent combination of the outputs from optical parametric chirped-pulse amplifiers.},

We review for the non-specialist some recent experimental and theoretical work dealing with high harmonic generation (HHG) in molecules. Particular attention is paid to two types of experiment recently performed in our group. The first of these types of experiment is the measurement of signatures of molecular electronic structure using HHG from molecules with a fixed orientation in space. The second is the use of HHG to track extremely fast proton rearrangement following ionization in light molecules, using the intrinsic temporal variation of the recolliding electron energy to extract these dynamics from measurements of the high harmonics.},

Close to the specimen, the optical near fields are converted into a spatially varying electron flux using a planar photocathode. The electron flux is imaged using low-energy electron microscopy, enabling label-free nanometric resolution without the need to scan a probe across the sample.

We demonstrate SP light emission from nanoscale gratings with periodicity as small as 50 nm, enabling the observation of tunable visible radiation from low-energy electrons (1.5 to 6 keV), an order of magnitude lower in energy than previously reported. We study the emission wavelength and intensity dependence on the grating pitch and electron energy, showing agreement between experiment and theory.

  abstract = {Recent advances in the fabrication of nanostructures and nanoscale features in metasurfaces offer a new prospect for generating visible, light emission from low energy electrons. In this paper, we present the experimental observation of visible light emission from low-energy free electrons interacting with nanoscale periodic surfaces through the Smith-Purcell (SP) effect. SP radiation is emitted when electrons pass in close proximity over a periodic structure, inducing collective charge motion or dipole excitations near the surface, thereby giving rise to electromagnetic radiation. We demonstrate a controlled emission of SP light from nanoscale gold gratings with periodicity as small as 50 nm, enabling the observation of visible SP radiation by low energy electrons (1.5 to 6 keV), an order of magnitude lower than previously reported. We study the emission wavelength and intensity dependence on the grating pitch and electron energy, showing agreement between experiment and theory. Further reduction of structure periodicity should enable the production of SP-based devices that operate with even slower electrons that allow an even smaller footprint and facilitate the investigation of quantum effects for light generation in nanoscale devices. A tunable light source integrated in an electron microscope would enable the development of novel electron-optical correlated spectroscopic techniques, with additional applications ranging from biological imaging to solid-state lighting.},

The octave is reached at 25 dB below the average power level. The in-loop accumulated phase error is 1.4 rad (20 mHz to 1 MHz).

The nanocryotron has a demonstrated gain of {$>$}20, can drive impedances of 100 k{$\Omega$}, and operates in typical ambient magnetic fields. We have additionally applied it both as a digital logic element in a half-adder circuit, and as a digital amplifier for superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors pulses.

This is in stark contrast to ionization in semiconductors and is currently unexplained.

Our single-particle analysis identifies this as a potential reason for the different ionization behavior. The dynamic Stark shift increases the band gap with increasing laser intensities, thus suppressing ionization to an extent where virtual population oscillations become dominant. The dynamic Stark shift plays a role dominantly in dielectrics which, due to the larger band gap, can be exposed to significantly higher laser intensities.},

As an application example, we fabricate new modulator devices with an electro-optic organic material in the slot waveguide and reach 50 and 100 Gbit/s data modulation in the O- and C-bands within the same device.

Soc. 1991, 113, 2826] was modified and extended at several points. The synthesis of very small ZnO nuclei was simplified. It was found that aging of particles was governed by temperature, the water content, and the presence of reaction products. Water and acetate induced considerably accelerated particle growth. Growth could almost be stopped by removal of these species (``washing''). Washing consisted of repeated precipitation of ZnO by addition of alkanes such as heptane, removal of the supernatant, and redispersion in ethanol. The aging characteristics are interpreted in terms of the concentration of dissolved ZnII species and reactions well-known in sol-gel chemistry. These findings present a better-defined and more versatile procedure for production of clean ZnO sols of readily adjustable particle size. Such sols are of particular interest for studies of electrical and optical properties of ZnO nanoparticle films. For example, films exhibiting {$>$}99\% transparency in the visible region could only be obtained by deposition from a washed sol.}

It may couple to excitations in the substrate (surface plasmons, for example) via the long-ranged Coulomb interaction, as is well known from electron energy-loss spectroscopy. Joynt has argued that such losses can be severe for poor conductors, with the consequence that their inclusion is essential for the interpretation of their photoemission spectra. We show that the losses considered by Joynt have their origin simply in the work done by the image force experienced by the outgoing electron. This then just shifts the kinetic energy of all photoemitted electrons downward by roughly the same amount, save for a correction with origin in the velocity dependence of the effective image force.},

A bicircular  field consists of two coplanar corotating or counter-rotating  circularly polarized fields having different frequencies. For the  total detachment rate of a negative ion by a bicircular field we  observe threshold anomalies and explain them using the Wigner  threshold law and energy and angular momentum conservation. For the  corotating bicircular case, these effects are negligible, while for  the counter-rotating case they are pronounced and their position  depends on the magnetic quantum number of the initial state. For  high-order above-threshold ionization of rare-gas atoms by a  counter-rotating bicircular laser field we observe very pronounced  intensity-dependent enhancements. We find all four types of  threshold anomalies known from collision theory. Contrary to the  case of linear polarization, channel-closing effects for a  bicircular field are visible also in the cutoff region of the  electron energy spectrum, which is explained using quantum-orbit  theory.},

We have improved the system further, maximum burst power is 104W (100kHz, 1 mJ EUV power @ intermediate focus), laser-EUV conversion efficiency is 2.5\%. Also continuous operation time is so far up to 8 hours with 5\% duty cycle is achieved. We have investigated EUV plasma creation scheme by small experimental device which is facilitated 10Hz operation (maximum). We have proposed double pulse method to create LPP plasma efficiently. This moment we found out 3.3\% conversion efficiency operation condition. Based on the engineering data of ETS and small experimental device, now we are developing 2nd generation HVM source; GL200E. The device consists of the original concepts (1) CO\textsubscript{2} laser driven Sn plasma, (2) Hybrid CO\textsubscript{2} laser system that is combination of high speed (\&gt;100kHz) short pulse oscillator and industrial cw-CO\textsubscript{2}, (3) Magnetic mitigation, and (4) Double pulse EUV plasma creation.

Formulations for a stable and efficient numerical implementation of the analysis technique are presented for one-dimensional binary gratings for both TE and TM polarization and for the general case of conical diffraction. It is shown that by exploitation of the symmetry of the diffraction problem a very efficient formulation, with up to an order-of-magnitude improvement in the numerical efficiency, is produced. The rigorous coupled-wave analysis is shown to be inherently stable. The sources of potential numerical problems associated with underflow and overflow, inherent in digital calculations, are presented. A formulation that anticipates and preempts these instability problems is presented. The calculated diffraction efficiencies for dielectric gratings are shown to converge to the correct value with an increasing number of space harmonics over a wide range of parameters, including very deep gratings. The effect of the number of harmonics on the convergence of the diffraction efficiencies is investigated. More field harmonics are shown to be required for the convergence of gratings with larger grating periods, deeper gratings, TM polarization, and conical diffraction.},

Among them, exciton formation has been identified as a crucial phenomenon which deeply affects the electro-optical properties of most semiconductors and insulators of technological interest. While recent experiments based on attosecond spectroscopy techniques have demonstrated the possibility to observe the early-stage exciton dynamics, the description of the underlying exciton properties remains non-trivial. In this work we propose a new method called extended Ptychographic Iterative engine for eXcitons (ePIX), capable of reconstructing the main physical properties which determine the evolution of the quasi-particle with no prior knowledge of the exact relaxation dynamics or the pump temporal characteristics. By demonstrating its accuracy even when the exciton dynamics is comparable to the pump pulse duration, ePIX is established as a powerful approach to widen our knowledge of solid-state physics.},

One would expect that very intense fields would always lead to fast ionization of atoms or molecules. However, recently observed acceleration of neutral atoms [Eichmann et al. (2009) Nature 461:1261\textendash 1264] at the rate of 1015 m/s2 when exposed to very intense IR laser pulses demonstrated that substantial fraction of atoms remained stable during the pulse. Here we show that the electronic structure of these stable ``laser-dressed'' atoms can be directly imaged by photoelectron spectroscopy. Our findings open the way to visualizing and controlling bound electron dynamics in strong laser fields and reexamining its role in various strong-field processes, including microscopic description of high order Kerr nonlinearities and their role in laser filamentation [B\'ejot et al.

  abstract = {Carrier-envelope phase (CEP) detection of ultrashort optical pulses and low-energy waveform field sampling have recently been demonstrated using direct time-domain methods that exploit optical-field photoemission from plasmonic nanoantennas. These devices make for compact and integratable solid-state detectors operating at optical frequency that work in ambient conditions and require minute pulse energies (picojoule-level). Applications include frequency-comb stabilization, visible to near-infrared time-domain spectroscopy, compact tools for attosecond science and metrology and, due to the high electronic switching speeds, petahertz-scale information processing. However, these devices have been driven by free-space optical waveforms and their implementation within integrated photonic platforms has yet to be demonstrated. In this work, we design and simulate fully-integrated plasmonic bow-tie nanoantennas coupled to a Si\$\_3\$N\$\_4\$-core waveguide for CEP detection. We find that when coupled to realistic on-chip, few-cycle supercontinuum sources, these devices are suitable for direct time-domain CEP detection within integrated photonic platforms. We estimate a signal-to-noise ratio of 30 dB at 50 kHz resolution bandwidth. We address technical details, such as the tuning of the nanoantennas plasmonic resonance and the waveform's CEP slippage in the waveguide. Moreover, we evaluate power losses due to absorption and scattering and we study the device sensitivity to pulse duration and pulse peak field intensity. Our results provide the basis for future design and fabrication of time-domain CEP detectors and allow for the development of fully-integrated attosecond science applications, frequency-comb stabilization and light-wave-based PHz electronics.},

  abstract = {Calculating strong-field, momentum-resolved photoelectron spectra (PES) from numerical solutions of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (TDSE) is a very demanding task due to the large spatial excursions and drifts of electrons in intense laser fields. The time-dependent surface flux (t-SURFF) method for the calculation of PES [Tao and Scrinzi (2012)] allows to keep the numerical grid much smaller than the space over which the wavefunction would be spread at the end of the laser pulse. We present an implementation of the t-SURFF method in the well established TDSE-solver Qprop [Bauer and Koval (2006)]. Qprop efficiently propagates wavefunctions for single-active electron systems with spherically symmetric binding potentials in classical, linearly (along z) or elliptically (in the xy-plane) polarized laser fields in dipole approximation. Its combination with t-SURFF makes the simulation of PES feasible in cases where it is just too expensive to keep the entire wavefunction on the numerical grid, e.g.,~in the long-wavelength or long-pulse regime. Program title: Qprop Catalogue identifier: ADXB\_v2\_0 Program summary URL:http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/ADXB\_v2\_0.html Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University, Belfast, N. Ireland Licensing provisions: GNU General Public License, version 3 No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 12458 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 86258 Distribution format: at.gz Programming language: C++. Computer: x86\_64. Operating system: Linux. RAM: The memory requirements for calculating PES are determined by the maximum {$\mathscr{l}$} in the spherical harmonics expansion of the wave function and the number of momentum (or energy) values for which the PES are to be calculated. The example with the largest memory demand (large-clubs) uses approximately 6GB of RAM. The size of the numerical representation of a wavefunction during propagation is modest for the examples included (53 MB for the large-club example). Number of processors used: The evaluation of the PES can be distributed over up to Nk MPI processes (Nk is the number of momentum values). Catalogue identifier of previous version: ADXB\_v1\_0 Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Comm. 174(2006)396 Classification: 2.5. External routines: GNU Scientific Library, Open MPI (optional), BOOST (optional) Does the new version supersede the previous version?: For TDDFT calculations the previous version should be used. Nature of problem: When atoms are ionized by intense laser fields electrons may escape with large momenta (especially when rescattering is involved). This translates to a rapidly spreading wavefunction in numerical simulations of these systems thus rendering the calculation of PES very costly for increasing wave lengths and peak intensities. Solution method: The TDSE is solved by propagating the wavefunction using a Crank\textendash Nicolson propagator. The wavefunction is represented by an expansion in spherical harmonics. In order to reduce the requirements with respect to the grid size the t-SURFF method is used to calculate PES. Reasons for new version: Using the window operator method to calculate PES is increasingly costly with increasing ponderomotive energies and pulse durations. The new version of Qprop provides an implementation of the t-SURFF method which allows the use of much smaller numerical grids. Summary of revisions: An implementation of the t-SURFF method and examples for calculating PES are provided in the new release. Restrictions: The dipole approximation for the laser interaction has to be applicable. t-SURFF is only implemented for velocity gauge. Furthermore a finite cutoff for long range binding potentials has to be used in the implemented t-SURFF method. Additional comments: For additional information see www.qprop.de Running time: Depends strongly on the laser interaction studied. The examples given in this paper have run times from a few minutes to 12.5~hours.},

  abstract = {Although the theories of thermionic and field emission of electrons from metals are very well understood, the two types of emission have usually been studied separately by first specifying the range of temperature and field and then constructing the appropriate expression for the current. In this paper the emission is treated from a unified point of view in order to establish the ranges of temperature and field for the two types of emission and to investigate the current in the region intermediate between thermionic and field emission. A general expression for the emitted current as a function of field, temperature, and work function is set up in the form of a definite integral. Each type of emission is then associated with a technique for approximating the integral and with a characteristic dependence on the three parameters. An approximation for low fields and high temperatures leads to an extension of the Richardson-Schottky formula for thermionic emission. The values of temperature and field for which it applies are established by considering the validity of the approximation. An analogous treatment of the integral, for high fields and low temperatures, gives an extension of the Fowler-Nordheim formula for field emission, and establishes the region of temperature and field in which it applies. Also another approximate method for evaluating the integral is given which leads to a new type of dependence of the emitted current on temperature and field and which applies in a narrow region of temperature and field intermediate between the field and thermionic emission regions.},

However, this is only accessible if the influence of the streaking infrared (IR) field on the emission process is properly accounted for. The IR probe field can strongly modify the observed streaking phase shift. We show that the part of the phase shift ('time shift') due to the interaction between the outgoing electron and the combined Coulomb and IR laser fields can be described classically. By contrast, the strong initial-state dependence of the streaking phase shift is only revealed through the solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation in its full dimensionality. We find a time delay between the hydrogenic 2s and 2p initial states in He+ exceeding 20 as for a wide range of IR intensities and XUV energies.},

In a single Ar gas cell, we showed that the chirp compensation could be achieved in the same harmonic generation cell, obtaining near transform-limited 206-as pulses. We could demonstrate also the generation of much shorter 63-as pulses by obtaining the harmonics from Ne and by compensating for the attosecond chirp in the second gas cell of Ar. The chirp compensation in gaseous media is, thus, very effective and powerful in obtaining near transform-limited attosecond pulses\textemdash very valuable for attosecond science.},

These relations use diverse measures to quantify uncertainty (and joint uncertainty). In this paper we use operational information-theoretic principles to identify the common essence of all such measures, thereby defining measure-independent notions of uncertainty and joint uncertainty. We find that most existing entropic uncertainty relations use measures of joint uncertainty that yield themselves to a small class of operational interpretations. Our notion relaxes this restriction, revealing previously unexplored joint uncertainty measures. To illustrate the utility of our formalism, we derive an uncertainty relation based on one such new measure. We also use our formalism to gain insight into the conditions under which measure-independent uncertainty relations can be found.},

Using applied DC voltages and optical illumination, we tested the electronic and optoelectronic response of the devices, demonstrating sub-10 V tunneling operation across the free-space gaps, and quantum efficiency of up to 1 \texttimes{} 10-3 at 1.2 {$\mu$}m, which is comparable to a bulk silicon photodiode at the same wavelength and three orders of magnitude higher than with nearly identical gold devices. Tests demonstrated that the titanium silicon oxynitride nanostructures did not significantly degrade, exhibiting less than 5 nm of shrinking of the average gap dimensions over few-{$\mu$}m2 areas after 10 h of operation. Our results will be useful for developing the next generation of robust and CMOS-compatible nanoscale devices for high-speed and low-power field-emission electronics and optoelectronics applications.},

\item Compares doped vs. undoped performance

\item Simulation + experiment

\item Do see increase in yield of 3-4x -- not terribly high but significant

\item Models seem rather simplified -- but did not read supplemental

\begin{itemize}

\item They describe the rough cutoff and enhancement

\item However, they say that the cutoff for both is the same, which is odd and hints that it could be a coincidence that it has the correct yield enhancement prediction

\item Need to incorporate more complete bandstructure it seems

\end{itemize}

\item Energies out to 26 eV observed

\item Cr-doped samples turn on at lower laser fluence

\begin{itemize}

\item Consistent with observed decrease in bandgap of 1.8 eV

\item However, they claim this also corresponds to cutoff increase of doped films... but isn't that in the wrong direction?

\end{itemize}

This is interesting, but would want a stronger effect for getting the kinds of enhancements needed for a viable source.

However, it could be useful for getting that final factor of 3-4x after a scheme that really gets phase-matching down.~}

  abstract = {As charged particles surpass the speed of light in an optical medium they produce radiation - analogously to the way jet planes surpass the speed of sound and produce a sonic boom. This radiation emission, known as the Cherenkov effect, is among the most fundamental processes in electrodynamics. As such, it is used in numerous applications of particle detectors, particle accelerators, light sources, and medical imaging. Surprisingly, all Cherenkov-based applications and experiments thus far were fully described by classical electrodynamics even though theoretical work predicts new Cherenkov phenomena coming from quantum electrodynamics. The quantum description could provide new possibilities for the design of highly controllable light sources and more efficient accelerators and detectors. Here, we provide a direct evidence of the quantum nature of the Cherenkov effect and reveal its intrinsic quantum features. By satisfying the Cherenkov condition for relativistic electron wavefunctions and maintaining it over hundreds of microns, each electron simultaneously accelerates and decelerates by absorbing and emitting hundreds of photons in a coherent manner. We observe this strong interaction in an ultrafast transmission electron microscope, achieving for the first time a phase-matching between a relativistic electron wavefunction and a propagating light wave. Consequently, the quantum wavefunction of each electron evolves into a coherent plateau, analogous to a frequency comb in ultrashort laser pulses, containing hundreds of quantized energy peaks. Our findings prove that the delocalized wave nature of electrons can become dominant in stimulated interactions. In addition to prospects for known applications of the Cherenkov effect, our work provides a platform for utilizing quantum electrodynamics for applications in electron microscopy and in free-electron pump-probe spectroscopy.},

We measured the terahertz output as a function of optical illumination power and bias voltage from 50~GHz up to 1~THz, using a precisely calibrated terahertz power detector. We found that both emitters were comparable in their spectral power under the operating conditions specified by the manufacturers. While the PIN-PD turned out to be more robust against varying operating parameters, the UTC-PD showed no saturation of the emitted terahertz power even for 50~mW optical input power. In addition, we compared the terahertz transmission and infrared (IR) blocking ratio of four different filter materials. These filters are a prerequisite for correct measurements of the absolute terahertz power with thermal detectors.},

Bulk silicon has an indirect energy bandgap and is therefore highly inefficient as a light source, necessitating the use of other materials for the optical emitters. However, the introduction of these materials is usually incompatible with the strict processing requirements of existing ULSI technologies. Moreover, as the length scale of the devices decreases, electrons will spend increasingly more of their time in the connections between components; this interconnectivity problem could restrict further increases in computer chip processing power and speed in as little as five years. Many efforts have therefore been directed, with varying degrees of success, to~engineering silicon-based materials that are efficient light emitters2,3,4,5,6,7. Here, we describe the fabrication, using standard silicon processing techniques, of a silicon light-emitting diode (LED) that operates efficiently at room temperature. Boron is implanted into silicon both as a dopant to form a p\textendash n junction, as well as a means of introducing dislocation loops. The dislocation loops introduce a local strain field, which modifies the band structure and provides spatial confinement of the charge carriers. It is this spatial confinement which allows room-temperature electroluminescence at the band-edge. This device strategy is highly compatible with ULSI technology, as boron ion implantation is already used as a standard method for the fabrication of silicon devices.},

The nanoscale dimensions of such arrays allow for enhanced charge extraction from PV active layers, but the device performance critically depends on the nanowire array pitch and alignment. In this study, we templated hydrothermally-grown ZnO nanowire arrays via high-resolution electron-beam-lithography defined masks, achieving the dual requirements of high-resolution patterning at a pitch of several hundred nanometers, while maintaining hole sizes small enough to control nanowire array morphology. We investigated several process conditions, including the effect of annealing sputtered and spincoated ZnO seed layers on nanowire growth, to optimize array property metrics\textemdash branching from individual template holes and off-normal alignment. We found that decreasing template hole size decreased branching prevalence but also reduced alignment. Annealing seed layers typically improved alignment, and sputtered seed layers yielded nanowire arrays superior to spincoated seed layers. We show that these effects arose from variation in the size of the template holes relative to the ZnO grain size in the seed layer. The quantitative control of branching and alignment of the nanowire array that is achieved in this study will open new paths toward engineering more efficient electrodes to increase photocurrent in nanostructured PVs. This control is also applicable to inorganic nanowire growth in general, nanomechanical generators, nanowire transistors, and surface-energy engineering.},

  abstract = {Scattering-free transport in vacuum tubes has always been superior to solid-state transistors. It is the advanced fabrication with mass production capability at low cost which drove solid-state nanoelectronics. Here, we combine the best of vacuum tubes with advanced nanofabrication technology. We present nanoscale, metal-based, field emission air channel transistors. Comparative analysis of tungsten-, gold-, and platinum-based devices is presented. Devices are fabricated with electron beam lithography, achieving channel lengths less than 35 nm. With this small channel length, vacuum-like carrier transport is possible in air under room temperature and pressure. Source and drain electrodes have planar, symmetric, and sharp geometry. Because of this, devices operate in bidirection with voltages {$<$}2 V and current values in few tens of nanoamperes range. The experimental data shows that influential operation mechanism is Fowler\textendash Nordheim tunnelling in tungsten and gold devices, while Schottky emission in platinum device. The presented work enables a technology where metal-based switchable nanoelectronics can be created on any dielectric surface with low energy requirements.},

  abstract = {Some EUV light sources have been promoted that use LPPs, and some that use DPPs (see, for example, Ref. 1). Although each proposed source has significant advantages, the LPP offers an especially attractive prospective application range due to advances in laser technology and tunability of the source emission by target-material selection. The LPP EUV light source also has the advantages of small source size, due to the focusability of the laser, and less debris in that the target is isolated from the energy driver. Many of the sources under consideration use 13.5-nm radiation from multicharged xenon, tin, and other low-Z ions, because Mo/Si multilayer mirrors have high reflectivity at this wavelength. One key requirement in the source development is a high conversion efficiency (CE) from the incident laser energy on the target to 13.5-nm EUV emission energy in a 2\% bandwidth over 2{$\pi$} sr. Figure 11.1(a) summarizes recent experimental values of the CE for various types of targets, such as the xenon liquid jet, xenon cluster jet, cryogenic xenon, frozen xenon, solid tin, and liquid tin jet. A CE of a few percent is achieved for tin, and a relatively small CE of {$\leq$} 1\% is obtained for xenon.},

After a brief overview of the physical mechanisms at the basis of attosecond pulse generation, the experimental methods used for the production of isolated sub-femtosecond pulses are discussed, with particular emphasis on the polarization gating method, which is based on the use of driving pulses with a time-dependent polarization state. The recent emergence of attosecond metrology is described and various techniques for temporal characterization of extreme ultraviolet pulses in the sub-femtosecond regime are analyzed. The streak-camera approach turned out to be an extremely powerful method: all applications of isolated attosecond pulses reported so far are essentially based on such experimental approach. We furthermore discuss recently proposed applications of isolated attosecond pulses in various research fields. Particularly interesting will be the application of attosecond pulses to the investigation of multielectron systems. The collective electronic motion in complex systems and the electron correlation mechanisms represent fundamental problems in atomic and molecular physics, both from a theoretical and an experimental point of view: the application of attosecond pulses promises to offer a formidable tool for the experimental investigation of such fundamental physical processes. Moreover the possibility to directly measure and control the ultrafast charge migration process in complex molecules, which is at the basis of fundamental processes in nature, can open the way to the emergence of attochemistry, with important consequences both for fundamental research and technology.},

When we require that all Grover iterations use the same crystal, and account for potential experimental limitations on crystal-length precision, our optimized conversion efficiencies reach unity for 1{$\leq$}n{$\leq$}5, after which they decrease monotonically for n values up to 50, which is the upper limit of our numerical dynamics evaluations. Nevertheless, our conversion efficiencies remain higher than those for a conventional (no NSGs) down-converter.},

Strong experimental support for this mechanism as origin of excited neutral atoms stems from the dependence of the excited neutral yield on the laser ellipticity, which is as expected for a rescattering process. Theoretical support for the proposed mechanism comes from the agreement of the neutral excited state distribution centered at n=6\textendash 10 obtained from both, a full quantum mechanical and a semiclassical calculation, in agreement with the experimental results.},

In particular, free electron light sources have gained much attention due to their ability to tune and direct light emission. Here, we show that radiation from free electrons passing through a 100~nm wide nanohole can reach as high as 90\% of the theoretical limit. This is accomplished through the introduction of a circular nanoridge around the hole to form a structure we call the nanowell. The power radiated from the nanowell exceeds that of a regular nanohole by over 100 times and that of nanoholes surrounded by other features, such as bullseyes, by similar enhancement factors. Upon varying the structural parameters of the nanowell, the peak output wavelength can be tuned over a broad frequency range from the visible to the near-infrared. This reveals a route to extracting power from free electrons via material nanopatterning.},

Over the past decade, the development of chip-scale platforms has enabled compact integrated waveguides for supercontinuum generation. However, there is a critical need for an on-chip self-referencing system that is adaptive to different pump wavelengths, requires low pulse energy, and does not require complicated processing. Here, we demonstrate efficient fCEO stabilization of a modelocked laser with only 107 pJ of pulse energy via self-referencing in an integrated lithium niobate waveguide. We realize an f-2f interferometer through second-harmonic generation and subsequent supercontinuum generation in a single dispersion-engineered waveguide with a stabilization performance equivalent to a conventional off-chip module. The fCEO beatnote is measured over a pump wavelength range of 70 nm. We theoretically investigate our system using a single nonlinear envelope equation with contributions from both second- and third-order nonlinearities. Our modeling reveals rich ultrabroadband nonlinear dynamics and confirms that the initial second-harmonic generation followed by supercontinuum generation with the remaining pump is responsible for the generation of a strong fCEO signal as compared to a traditional f-2f interferometer. Our technology provides a highly simplified system that is robust, low in cost, and adaptable for precision metrology for use outside a research laboratory.},

  abstract = {The response of solids to electromagnetic fields is of crucial importance in many areas of science and technology. Many fundamental questions remain to be answered about the dynamics of the photoexcited electrons that underpin this response, which can evolve on timescales of tens to hundreds of attoseconds. How, for example, is the photoexcited electron affected by the periodic potential as it travels in the solid, and how do the other electrons respond in these strongly correlated systems? Furthermore, control of electronic motion in solids with attosecond precision would pave the way for the development of ultrafast optoelectronics. Attosecond electron dynamics can be traced using streaking, a technique in which a strong near-infrared laser field accelerates an attosecond electron wavepacket photoemitted by an extreme ultraviolet light pulse, imprinting timing information onto it. We present attosecond streaking measurements on the wide-bandgap semiconductor tungsten trioxide, and on gold, a metal used in many nanoplasmonic devices. Information about electronic motion in the solid is encoded on the temporal properties of the photoemitted electron wavepackets, which are consistent with a spread of electron transport times to the surface following photoexcitation.},

In the terahertz domain, where high-resolution imagers are mostly unavailable, ghost imaging is an optimal approach to embed the temporal dimension, creating a ``hyperspectral'' imager. In this framework, high resolution is mostly out of reach. Hence, it is particularly critical to developing practical approaches for microscopy. Here we experimentally demonstrate time-resolved nonlinear ghost imaging, a technique based on near-field, optical-to-terahertz nonlinear conversion and detection of illumination patterns. We show how space\textendash time coupling affects near-field time-domain imaging, and we develop a complete methodology that overcomes fundamental systematic reconstruction issues.

  abstract = {Emission of high-order harmonics from solids provides a new avenue in attosecond science. On one hand, it allows to investigate fundamental processes of the non-linear response of electrons driven by a strong laser pulse in a periodic crystal lattice. On the other hand, it opens new paths toward efficient attosecond pulse generation, novel imaging of electronic wave functions, and enhancement of high-order harmonic generation (HHG) intensity. A key feature of HHG in a solid (as compared to the well-understood phenomena of HHG in an atomic gas) is the delocalization of the process, whereby an electron ionized from one site in the periodic lattice may recombine with any other. Here, we develop an analytic model, based on the localized Wannier wave functions in the valence band and delocalized Bloch functions in the conduction band. This Wannier-Bloch approach assesses the contributions of individual lattice sites to the HHG process, and hence addresses precisely the question of localization of harmonic emission in solids. We apply this model to investigate HHG in a ZnO crystal for two different orientations, corresponding to wider and narrower valence and conduction bands, respectively. Interestingly, for narrower bands, the HHG process shows significant localization, similar to harmonic generation in atoms. For all cases, the delocalized contributions to HHG emission are highest near the band-gap energy. Our results pave the way to controlling localized contributions to HHG in a solid crystal, with hard to overestimate implications for the emerging area of atto-nanoscience.},

First, the "total-field/scattered-field" approach to creating incident plane waves is reviewed and seen to be a special case of the well-known principle of equivalence in electromagnetism: this can be used to construct "equivalent" current sources for any desired incident field, including waveguide modes. The effects of dispersion and discretization are discussed, and a simple technique to separate incident and scattered fields is described in order to compensate for imperfect equivalent currents. The important concept of the local density of states (LDOS) is reviewed, which elucidates the relationship between current sources and the resulting fields, including enhancement of the LDOS via mode cutoffs (Van Hove singularities) and resonant cavities (Purcell enhancement). We also address various other source techniques such as covering a wide range of frequencies and incident angles in a small number of simulations for waves incident on a periodic surface, sources to excite eigenmodes in rectangular supercells of periodic systems, moving sources, and thermal sources via a Monte Carlo/Langevin approach.},

In particular, the underlying coordinate-stretching idea behind PML breaks down in photonic crystals and in other structures where the material is not an analytic function in the direction perpendicular to the boundary, leading to substantial reflections. The alternative is an adiabatic absorber, in which reflections are made negligible by gradually increasing the material absorption at the boundaries, similar to a common strategy to combat discretization reflections in PMLs. We demonstrate the fundamental connection between such reflections and the smoothness of the absorption profile via coupled-mode theory, and show how to obtain higher-order and even exponential vanishing of the reflection with absorber thickness (although further work remains in optimizing the constant factor).},

Stearns and coworkers first demonstrated a reflectivity of 61\% at this wavelength using Mo/Si multilayer optics, a figure that has been improved in the intervening period to a present value close to 72\%. Ceglio and Hawryluk proposed that a suitable scheme would require a 1\% conversion efficiency (CE) of incident laser pulse energy to soft x rays in a 0.3-nm band centered at this peak. Kauffman et al. attained this figure using 7.5-ns, 300-mJ frequency-doubled Nd:YAG pulses focused to a power density of 2 \texttimes{} 1011 W cm-2 onto a tin target. This figure has now been revised upwards because of the increased costs of producing a suitable exposure tool, to better than 3\% CE into 2\% bandwidth, because this is necessary for the successful commercialization of such a source. Because of the debris problems associated with the use of tin, other target materials were sought with strong emission in the 13\textendash 14-nm region. Jin and Richardson used mass-limited water ice targets that emitted O VI lines near 13 nm to limit the debris. Shevelko et al. subsequently undertook an extensive study of the spectra of a large number of elements from LPPs with a KrF excimer laser focused to a power density of 1012 W cm-2 onto planar targets, including tin, and found that the maximum intensity was in fact obtained for Ge and Re targets under these conditions. However, all of their work was with solid targets that produced significant debris in the form of both ions and particulates of various sizes. The need to reduce particulate emission led to the choice of xenon, which as an inert gas should provide a debris-free source. There is a line group in the spectrum of xenon that has been shown by a number of researchers to arise from 4d8-4d7 5p transitions in Xe XI. These lines have recently been measured to an accuracy of 0.01 nm by Churilov et al., who have identified all of the lines in this range by comparison with atomic structure calculations using the suite of codes developed by Cowan. The population of this ion stage needs to be optimized to attain maximum intensity. Note that, depending on the type of source and hence ion density, optimization is not always necessarily the same as maximizing a given ion population because of opacity effects.},

  abstract = {The concerted motion of two or more bound electrons governs atomic and molecular non-equilibrium processes including chemical reactions, and hence there is much interest in developing a detailed understanding of such electron dynamics in the quantum regime. However, there is no exact solution for the quantum three-body problem, and as a result even the minimal system of two active electrons and a nucleus is analytically intractable. This makes experimental measurements of the dynamics of two bound and correlated electrons, as found in the helium atom, an attractive prospect. However, although the motion of single active electrons and holes has been observed with attosecond time resolution, comparable experiments on two-electron motion have so far remained out of reach. Here we show that a correlated two-electron wave packet can be reconstructed from a 1.2-femtosecond quantum beat among low-lying doubly excited states in helium. The beat appears in attosecond transient-absorption spectra measured with unprecedentedly high spectral resolution and in the presence of an intensity-tunable visible laser field. We tune the coupling between the two low-lying quantum states by adjusting the visible laser intensity, and use the Fano resonance as a phase-sensitive quantum interferometer to achieve coherent control of the two correlated electrons. Given the excellent agreement with large-scale quantum-mechanical calculations for the helium atom, we anticipate that multidimensional spectroscopy experiments of the type we report here will provide benchmark data for testing fundamental few-body quantum dynamics theory in more complex systems. They might also provide a route to the site-specific measurement and control of metastable electronic transition states that are at the heart of fundamental chemical reactions.},

  abstract = {The article surveys the state of the art in the design, development and application of devices for deterministically generating single photons on demand. Both the defined function and requisite form of such `single-photon' sources are explained in detail. Their attributes and characteristics, in particular the photon-counting statistics of the light that they generate, are presented in conjunction with the experimental apparatus (most notably the Hanbury-Brown and Twiss interferometer) for measuring them. Promising applications of single-photon sources within quantum key distribution, quantum information processing, as well as metrology and fundamental tests of quantum mechanics, are described. The utility and relative advantages of single-photon sources vis-\'a-vis more conventional sources of light are explained in terms of application-specific requirements and the respective abilities of different sources to fulfil them. The article collects, classifies and sorts the most significant work towards realizing practical single-photon sources to date. Though emanating from a diverse set of technological disciplines, with different research and application objectives in mind, the relative advantages and drawbacks of each approach are assessed, to give the reader a broad yet coherent and critical review of a rapidly developing research front.},

For two different geometries, we analyze the temporal and spatial broadening during propagation from the needle emitter to an anode, identifying the experimental parameters and challenges for realizing femtosecond time resolution. The simple tip-anode geometry is most versatile and allows for electron pulses of several ten of femtosecond duration using a very compact experimental design, however, providing very limited control over the electron beam collimation. A more sophisticated geometry comprising a suppressor-extractor electrostatic unit and a lens, similar to typical field emission electron microscope optics, is also investigated, allowing full control over the beam parameters. Using such a design, we find {$\sim$} 230 fs pulses feasible in a focused electron beam. The main limitation to achieve sub-hundred femtosecond time resolution is the typical size of such a device, and we suggest the implementation of more compact electron optics for optimal performance.},

Inner-shell ionization is the dominant ionization mechanism for x-rays and it is followed by secondary processes like fluorescence, Auger decay, and shake-up. In general, we find that inner-shell ionization and secondary processes can create additional delay-dependent modulations that will affect pulse reconstruction schemes. Our recently proposed pulse characterization method (Pabst and Dahlstr\"om 2016 Phys. Rev.

In this paper we show that slow charge transfer is an intrinsic property of triplet states in this material and most likely not connected with the triplet pair states that may result from singlet fission. We compare two perylene diimide/pentacene charge transfer systems that differ only by triplet generation mechanism: SF versus intersystem crossing (ISC), sensitized by using a soluble lead phthalocyanine derivative. We use time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) to measure the charge yield in each system and transient absorption (TA) to follow the triplet population dynamics. These experiments are described by a single global kinetic model, with most of its parameters fixed via control experiments. While we observe modest differences in the charge-transfer rate constants between each sample, 4\textendash 10\texttimes{} as a function of triplet generation mechanism, all samples remain far below the predicted diffusion-limited rate constant of 107\textendash 108 s\textendash 1.},

Therefore, this paper focuses on deriving the frequency equation for the in-plane vibration of the clamped circular plate of uniform thickness with an isotropic material in the elastic range. To derive the frequency equation for the clamped circular plate in the cylindrical coordinate, kinetic and potential energy for in-plane behavior were first obtained by using the stress-strain-displacement expressions and applying Hamilton's principle, which led to two sets of highly coupled differential equations for the equations of motion. Substitution of Helmholtz decomposition for the coupled differential equations produced uncoupled equations of motion. The assumption of a harmonic solution for the uncoupled equations led to wave equations. Using the separation of the variable, the general solutions for the wave equations were obtained. The solutions generated the in-plane displacements in the r and [theta] directions. Finally, the application of boundary conditions yielded the frequency equation for the clamped circular plate. The derived frequency equation was validated by finite element analysis and by comparison of previously reported results.}

However, elaborate pump\textendash probe experiments performed on the attosecond timescale require continuous efforts to improve the spatiotemporal coherence and also the repetition rate of the generated pulses. Here, we demonstrate a three-dimensional metallic waveguide for the plasmonic generation of ultrashort extreme-ultraviolet pulses by means of field enhancement using surface-plasmon polaritons. The intensity enhancement factor reaches a peak of \textasciitilde 350, allowing generation up to the 43rd harmonic in xenon gas, with a modest incident intensity of \textasciitilde 1 \texttimes{} 1011 W cm\textendash 2.

  abstract = {In this paper, we present experimental results on the effect of space charging in photoelectron spectroscopy from a surface using a pulsed and intense femtosecond light source. We particularly focus on a quantitative evaluation of the induced spectral broadening. Our results are compared with analytic calculations based on energy conservation considerations as well as with experimental results from measurements using picosecond pulses for the excitation process. As a measure of space charge effects, we monitored the angular and energy distributions of the photoemission from the occupied Shockley surface state of Cu(111) as a function of the total number N of the photoemitted electrons per laser pulse. Our results show that spectral distortions exist for the entire laser fluence regime probed. The energetic broadening of the surface state peak can be fitted with remarkable accuracy by a N dependence, in agreement with the theoretical predictions and different from the experimental picosecond results, where a dominating linear dependence has been reported. In addition to a pure energetic broadening of the photoemissionspectra, we also identify modifications in the angular distribution of the photoemitted electrons due to space charge effects.},

Because intense laser\textendash matter interactions generally depend on the electric field of the pulse, the absolute phase is important for a number of nonlinear processes2,3,4,5,6,7,8. But clear evidence of absolute-phase effects has yet to be detected experimentally, largely because of the difficulty of stabilizing the absolute phase in powerful laser pulses. Here we use a technique that does not require phase stabilization to demonstrate experimentally the influence of the absolute phase of a short laser pulse on the emission of photoelectrons. Atoms are ionized by a short laser pulse, and the photoelectrons are recorded with two opposing detectors in a plane perpendicular to the laser beam. We detect an anticorrelation in the shot-to-shot analysis of the electron yield.},

It is demonstrated that the direction of electron emission from photoionized atoms can be controlled by varying the phase of the field, providing for the first time a tool for its accurate determination. Directing fast electron emission to the right or to the left with the light phase constitutes a new kind of coherent control.},

  abstract = {Coherent, broadband pulses of extreme ultraviolet light provide a new and exciting tool for exploring attosecond electron dynamics. Using photoelectron streaking, interferometric spectrograms can be generated that contain a wealth of information about the phase properties of the photoionization process. If properly retrieved, this phase information reveals attosecond dynamics during photoelectron emission such as multielectron dynamics and resonance processes. However, until now, the full retrieval of the continuous electron wavepacket phase from isolated attosecond pulses has remained challenging. Here, after elucidating key approximations and limitations that hinder one from extracting the coherent electron wavepacket dynamics using available retrieval algorithms, we present a new method called absolute complex dipole transition matrix element reconstruction (ACDC). We apply the ACDC method to experimental spectrograms to resolve the phase and group delay difference between photoelectrons emitted from Ne and Ar. Our results reveal subtle dynamics in this group delay difference of photoelectrons emitted form Ar. These group delay dynamics were not resolvable with prior methods that were only able to extract phase information at discrete energy levels, emphasizing the importance of a complete and continuous phase retrieval technique such as ACDC. Here we also make this new ACDC retrieval algorithm available with appropriate citation in return.},

Gas-phase molecules can be aligned in space using short laser pulses, permitting the measurement of molecular parameters in the molecular frame. Aligned molecules can be photoionized using a train of attosecond pulses, enabling the complete characterization of the partial waves making up the photoelectron angular distributions. Using a recolliding electron in the high harmonic process allows complex transition dipole matrix elements to be recorded (including their amplitude and phase) in the molecular frame. High harmonic spectroscopy makes it possible to image molecular orbitals and for unimolecular chemical reactions to be followed with femtosecond resolution. For example, the behaviour around conical intersections can be probed. Charge migration within molecules can be observed with sub-femtosecond resolution.},

These asymmetries are also found to satisfy an approximate scaling law involving the frequency and intensity of the attosecond pulse. In the presence of even a very weak IR pulse (having an intensity of the order of 10 11 \textendash 10 12 W cm -2 ), the attosecond pulse CEP-induced asymmetries in the ionized electron momentum distributions are found to be significantly augmented. In addition, for higher IR laser intensities, we observe for low electron energies peaks separated by the IR photon energy in one electron momentum direction along the laser polarization axis; in the opposite direction, we find structured peaks that are spaced by twice the IR photon energy. Possible physical mechanisms for such asymmetric, low-energy structures in the ionized electron momentum distribution are proposed.

To date, most THz detectors have focused just on signal intensity, an effort that discards half the signal in terms of the full optical state, including polarization. Peng et al. developed a THz detector based on crossed nanowires (arranged in a hash structure) that is capable of resolving the full state of the THz light. The approach provides a nanophotonic platform for the further development of THz-based technologies. Science, this issue p. 510 Terahertz radiation encompasses a wide band of the electromagnetic spectrum, spanning from microwaves to infrared light, and is a particularly powerful tool for both fundamental scientific research and applications such as security screening, communications, quality control, and medical imaging. Considerable information can be conveyed by the full polarization state of terahertz light, yet to date, most time-domain terahertz detectors are sensitive to just one polarization component. Here we demonstrate a nanotechnology-based semiconductor detector using cross-nanowire networks that records the full polarization state of terahertz pulses. The monolithic device allows simultaneous measurements of the orthogonal components of the terahertz electric field vector without cross-talk. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capabilities of the detector for the study of metamaterials. A nanowire-based device that can determine the full state of terahertz radiation is developed.

However, such light pulses are challenging to measure due to the need for femtosecond time resolution at difficult-to-detect wavelengths. Also, single-shot measurements are needed because severe pulse-to-pulse fluctuations are common. Here we demonstrate single-shot, complete field measurements by applying a novel version of frequency resolved optical gating. An EUV free electron laser beam creates a transient grating containing the pulse's electric field information, which is read out with a 400 nm probe pulse. By varying the time delay between two copies of the EUV pump, rather than between the pump and the probe, we separate the needed coherent wave mixing from the slow incoherent response.

We show that two-photon absorption governs the process of photoemission. High electron energies measured in such experiments are shown to be an effect due to the transport of a cloud of electrons. Its physical origin is the work of the Coulomb field on the center-of-mass trajectory of the electron cloud, depending on the external fields needed to cancel the space-charge effects.},

  abstract = {A variety of applications rely on the efficient generation of hot carriers within metal nanoparticles and charge transfer to surrounding molecules or materials. The optimization of such processes requires a detailed understanding of excited carrier spatial, temporal, and momentum distributions, which also leads to opportunities for active optical control over hot carrier dynamics on nanometer and femtosecond scales. Such capabilities are emerging in nanoplasmonic systems and typically rely on tuning optical polarization and/or frequency to selectively excite one or more discrete hot spots defined by the particle geometry. Here, we introduce a unique case in which hot electron excitation and emission distributions can instead be continuously controlled via linear laser polarization in the azimuthal plane of a gold nanoshell supported on a substrate. In this configuration, it is the laser field that breaks the azimuthal symmetry of the supported nanoshell and determines the plasmonic field distribution. Using angle-resolved photoelectron velocity map imaging, we find that the hot electrons are predominantly emitted orthogonal to the nanoshell dipolar surface plasmon resonance axis defined by the laser polarization. Furthermore, such anisotropic emission is only observed for nanoshells, while solid gold nanospheres are found to be isotropic emitters. We show that all of these effects are recapitulated via simulation of the plasmonic electric field distributions within the nanoparticle volume and ballistic Monte Carlo modeling of the hot electron dynamics. These results demonstrate a highly predictive level of understanding of the underlying physics and possibilities for ultrafast spatiotemporal control over hot carrier dynamics.},

The possibility to steer, control or switch such electron wave packets with light is expected to pave the way towards direct visualization of nanoplasmonic field dynamics and real-time probing of electron motion in solid-state nanostructures. Such pulses can be generated by strong-field-induced tunnelling and acceleration of electrons in the near-field of sharp gold tapers within one half-cycle of the driving laser field. Here, we show the effect of the carrier-envelope phase of the laser field on the generation and motion of strong-field-emitted electrons from such tips. We observe clear variations in the width of plateau-like photoelectron spectra characteristic of the subcycle regime. This is a step towards controlling the coherent electron motion in and around metallic nanostructures over ultrashort lengths and timescales. View full text},

The different position of the isolating collector gap in the stray magnetic field causes the electron motion in the retarding region to be in one case adiabatic and in the other case nonadiabatic. The kind of motion within the retarding field influences strongly the behavior of the gyrotron with a depressed collector. In the case of nonadiabatic motion a significant amount of transverse momentum is given to the electrons reflected at the collector potential. This causes the reflected electrons to be trapped between the magnetic mirror and the collector. The electrons escape from the trap by diffusion across the magnetic field to the body of the tube thus contributing to the body current. Despite the high body current there is no observable influence of the collector voltage on the RF output power. In the case of adiabatic motion the reflected electrons do not gain a sufficient amount of transverse momentum to be trapped by the magnetic mirror. They pass the cavity toward the gun and they are trapped between the negative gun potential and the collector. The interaction with the RF field by electrons traveling through the cavity enhances the diffusion in the velocity space thus enabling the trapped electrons to overcome the potential barrier and escape toward the collector. Therefore the body current stays at low values since in this case the reflected electrons do not contribute to it. However, at higher collector voltages a reduction of RF power occurred and some noise in the electron beam was observed.},

At the core of all such sources is a tradeoff between compactness and higher output radiation intensities. Conventional photonic devices are limited in size by their operating wavelength, which helps compactness at the cost of a small interaction area. Here, plasmonic modes supported by multilayer graphene metamaterials are shown to provide a larger interaction area with the electron beam, while also tapping into the extreme confinement of graphene plasmons to generate high-frequency photons with relatively low-energy electrons available from tabletop sources. For 5 MeV electrons, a metamaterial of 50 layers and length 50 \textmu m, and a beam current of 1.7 \textmu A, it is, for instance, possible to generate X-rays of intensity 1.5 \texttimes{} 107 photons sr-1 s-1 1\%BW, 580 times more than for a single-layer design. The frequency of the driving laser dynamically tunes the photon emission spectrum. This work demonstrates a unique free-electron light source, wherein the electron mean free path in a given material is longer than the device length, relaxing the requirements of complex electron beam systems and potentially paving the way to high-yield, compact, and tunable X-ray sources.},

TMD/TMD-HSs like WS2/MoS2 have type II band alignment and form long-lived (nanosecond) interlayer excitons following sub-100 fs interlayer charge transfer (ICT) from the photoexcited intralayer exciton. While many studies have demonstrated the ultrafast nature of ICT processes, we still lack a clear physical understanding of ICT due to the trade-off between temporal and frequency resolution in conventional transient absorption spectroscopy. Here, we perform two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES), a method with both high frequency and temporal resolution, on a large-area WS2/MoS2 HS where we unambiguously time resolve both interlayer hole and electron transfer with 34 {$\pm$} 14 and 69 {$\pm$} 9 fs time constants, respectively. We simultaneously resolve additional optoelectronic processes including band gap renormalization and intralayer exciton coupling.

The plasmonic surface increases absorption over normal metals by more than an order of magnitude, and due to the localization of fields, this results in over 6 orders of magnitude increase in effective nonlinear quantum yield. We demonstrate that the achieved quantum yield is high enough for use in rf photoinjectors operating as electron sources for MHz repetition rate x-ray free electron lasers.},

The multiatmosphere gas pressures required for bright, phase-matched emission also support laser beam self-confinement, further enhancing the x-ray yield.

We verify our scaling predictions experimentally by demonstrating phase matching in the soft X-ray region of the spectrum around 330 eV, using ultrafast driving laser pulses at 1.3-{$\mu$}m wavelength, in an extended, high-pressure, weakly ionized gas medium. We also show through calculations that scaling of the overall conversion efficiency is surprisingly favorable as the wavelength of the driving laser is increased, making tabletop, fully coherent, multi-keV X-ray sources feasible. The rapidly decreasing microscopic single-atom yield, predicted for harmonics driven by longer-wavelength lasers, is compensated macroscopically by an increased optimal pressure for phase matching and a rapidly decreasing reabsorption of the generated X-rays.},

In this case, a single high-power (100 TW) laser system generates intense laser pulses, which are used for both electron acceleration and scattering. Although such all-laser-based sources have been demonstrated to be bright and energetic in proof-of-principle experiments, to date they have lacked several important distinguishing characteristics of conventional Compton sources.

White-light scattering experiments in accordance with simulations show that the optical tunability of connected antennas is fully retained.

Typically, such correlated states of light arise from the extreme nonlinearity granted by quantum emitters that are strongly coupled to a photonic mode2,3. However, unavoidable dissipation (such as photon loss) blurs nonlinear quantum effects when such approaches are used. Here, we generate strongly correlated photon states using only weak coupling and taking advantage of dissipation. An ensemble of non-interacting waveguide-coupled atoms induces correlations between simultaneously arriving photons through collectively enhanced nonlinear interactions. These correlated photons experience less dissipation than the uncorrelated ones. Depending on the number of atoms, we experimentally observe strong photon bunching or antibunching of the transmitted light. This realization of a collectively enhanced nonlinearity may turn out to be transformational for quantum information science and opens new avenues for generating non-classical light, covering frequencies from the microwave to the X-ray regime.},

By modulating the phases and amplitudes of the spectral components in the photoexcitation pulse, we showed that the absolute quantity of 13-cis retinal formed upon excitation can be enhanced or suppressed by {$\pm$}20\% of the yield observed using a short transform-limited pulse having the same actinic energy. The shaped pulses were shown to be phase-sensitive at intensities too low to access different higher electronic states, and so these pulses apparently steer the isomerization through constructive and destructive interference effects, a mechanism supported by observed signatures of vibrational coherence. These results show that the wave properties of matter can be observed and even manipulated in a system as large and complex as a protein. Shaping of an ultrashort laser pulse creates quantum mechanical interferences that can enhance or inhibit the photoisomerization efficiency by up to 20 percent.

We investigate the influence of different parameters, namely laser intensity, nonlinear order, nature of the gas and position of the laser focus relative to the generating medium. We show that when the laser is focused before the atomic medium, harmonics with regular spatial profiles can be generated with reasonable conversion efficiency. Their divergence does not depend directly on the nonlinear order, the intensity or even the nature of the generating gas, but rather on the region of the spectrum the considered harmonic belongs to, which is determined by the combination of the three preceding elements. When the focus is drawn closer to the medium, the distributions get increasingly distorted, becoming annular with a significant divergence for a focus right into - or after - the jet. We perform numerical simulations of the angular distributions. The simulated profiles reproduce remarkably well the experimental trends and are thus used to interpret them.},

  abstract = {Light fields from modern high-intensity, femtosecond laser systems can produce electrical forces that rival the binding forces in atomic and solid-state systems. In this strong-field regime, conventional non-linear optics gives way to novel phenomena such as the production of attosecond bursts of electrons and photons. Strong laser fields are generally achieved with amplified, ultrafast laser pulses. In this thesis we explore phenomena unique to strong-fields by using optical resonators to passively enhance ultrafast laser pulses. We pursue two major themes in the area of ultrafast resonator-enhanced strong-field physics. First, we use plasmonic nanoparticles as nano-optical resonators to explore strong-field photoemission near nanostructures on the surface of a chip. We demonstrate strong-field photoemission with our chip-scale devices under ambient conditions. Additionally, we use the strong-field photoemission current to probe the ultrafast temporal response of the plasmonic nano-optical field around the nanoparticle emitters. We also show a carrier-envelope sensitive component of the photoemission current and develop a simple model to predict this sensitivity. Second, we investigate cavity-enhanced high-harmonic generation. In particular, we explore the design of novel optical cavities based on Bessel-Gauss modes. Such cavities might have the capability to allow perfect out-coupling for intra-cavity generated harmonics as well as to provide for extremely large mode areas on the cavity mirrors. We prototype a particular Bessel-Gauss cavity design and discuss the limitations of this approach.},

In the paper, we present a numerical study of these effects using a direct relativistic N-body model.

Field emission currents are estimated using the WKB approximation. The results presented here suggest an increase of the emission current due to the surface quantization of silicon and a reduction of the emission current due to a thin oxide layer.

For the oxide from 1 to 7 nm, the standard Fowler-Nordheim plot deviates from linearity and local weak oscillation occurs.},

Using a grating of 1200 lines/mm with an effective groove depth of 220 \AA{} we observe diffracted SHG in the n = -1, 0, and +1 orders. For the n = -1 order we measure an enhancement factor of 7000, which is the largest reported. By assuming a grating profile function that is 97\% sinusoidal with a 3\% admixture of the third spatial harmonic, we obtain a calculated enhancement factor that agrees with experiment to within 25\% for all three diffracted orders. The n = +1 diffracted intensity is particularly sensitive to the existence of a spatial third-harmonic Fourier component in the grating profile. These results demonstrate that the Rayleigh method may be used to predict accurately the enhancement of SHG due to diffractive coupling to surface plasmons.},

  year = {2013},
  abstract = {Space-charge limited flow is a topic of much interest and varied application.We extend existing understanding of space-charge limits by simulations,and develop new tools and techniques for doing these simulations along the way.The Child-Langmuir limit is a simple analytic solution for space-charge limitedcurrent density in a one-dimensional diode. It has been previously extended to two dimensionsby numerical calculation in planar geometries. By considering an axisymmetric cylindrical system with axial emission from a circular cathode of finite radius \$r\$ and outer drift tube \$R \&gt; r\$and gap length \$L\$, we further examine the space charge limit in two dimensions.We simulate a two-dimensional axisymmetric parallel plate diode of various aspect ratios (\$r/L\$),and develop a scaling law for the measured two-dimensional space-charge limit (2DSCL)relative to the Child-Langmuir limit as a function of the aspect ratio of the diode.These simulations are done with a large (\$100 T\$) longitudinal magnetic field to restrict electronmotion to 1D, with the two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulation code OOPIC.We find a scaling law that is a monotonically decreasing function of this aspect ratio,and the one-dimensional result is recovered in the limit as \$r \&gt;\&gt; L\$.The result is in good agreement with prior results in planar geometry,where the emission area is proportional to the cathode width.We find a weak contribution from the effects of the drift tube for current at the beam edge,and a strong contribution of high current-density ``wings'' at the outer-edge of the beam,with a very large relative contribution when the beam is narrow.Mechanisms for enhancing current beyond the Child-Langmuir limit remain a matter of great importance.We analyze the enhancement effects of upstream ion injection on the transmitted current in a one-dimensional parallel plate diode.Electrons are field-emitted at the cathode,and ions are injected at a controlled current from the anode.An analytic solution is derived for maximizing the electron current throughput in terms of the ion current.This analysis accounts for various energy regimes, from classical to fully relativistic.The analytical result is then confirmed by simulation of the diode in each energy regime.The simulation approach involved iteratively testing injected ion current,and treating the measured transmitted electron current as a feedback mechanism.The feedback loop was automated, allowing for a single simulation to locate the optimized current.By tuning the injected ion current, we are able to optimize the transmitted electron current.This tuning of the ion current is automated by the integration of a high-level Python interface,wrapping the C++ particle-in-cell simulation code OOPD1.In this particular system, analysis showed that simulation runtime would be a function of transit time, and thus ion mass.By experimenting with reduced ion mass, we were able to significantly reduce simulation times,while recovering the same physical results.Field-limited emission is an approach for using Gauss's law to to satisfy the space charge limit for emitting current in particle-in-cell simulations.We find that simple field-limited emission models make several assumptions,which introduce small, systematic errors in the system.We make a thorough analysis of each assumption,and ultimately develop and test a new emission scheme that accounts for each.The first correction we make is to allow for a non-zero surface field at the boundary.Since traditional field-emission schemes only aim to balance Gauss's law at the surface,a zero surface field is an assumed condition.But for many systems, this is not appropriate,so the addition of a \textbackslash emph\{target\} surface field is made.The next correction is to account for nonzero initial velocity,which, if neglected, results in a systematic underestimation of the current,due to assuming that all emitted charge will be weighted to the boundary,when in fact it will be weighted as a fraction strictly less than unity,depending on the distance across the initial cell the particle travels in its initial fractional timestep.A correction is made to the scheme, to use the actual particle weight to adjust the target emission.The final analyses involve geometric terms,analyzing the effects of cylindrical coordinates,and taking particular care to analyze the center of a cylindrical beam,as well as the outer edge of the beam, in Cartesian coordinates.We find that balancing Gauss's law at the edge of the beam is not the correct behavior,and that it is important to resolve the profile of the emitted current,in order to avoid systematic errors.A thorough analysis is done of the assumptions made in prior implementations,and corrections are introduced for cylindrical geometry,non-zero injection velocity, and non-zero surface field.Particular care is taken to determine special conditions for the outermost node,where we find that forcing a balance of Gauss's law would be incorrect.The new emission scheme is tested in a two-dimensional periodic simulation,to demonstrate that the Jaffe limit for a one-dimensional diode with finite initial velocity is recovered.We also extend the iterative scheme developed earlier,and apply it to determine a scaling law for the Child-Langmuir limitin an axisymmetric planar diode, with finite initial velocity.We find that the new scheme reproduces prior results,and in significantly less computation time due to no longer needing to overinject,and leads to rapid convergence of the surface field,using our new algorithmic optimization wrapper to seek the local limiting current along an emitter.},

A comparison with measurements on surface normal structures confirmed that the reflectance and the phase change on reflection from semiconductor\textendash metal interfaces (including the case of metallic multilayers) can be accurately described by use of the proposed models for the optical functions of metallic films and the matrix method for multilayer calculations.},

The three interaction methods, scan, sweep, and rhythm, enabled users to read Braille characters one at a time either by exploring the characters dot by dot or by sensing a rhythmic pattern presented on the screen. The methods were tested with five blind Braille readers as a proof of concept. The results of the first experiment showed that all three methods can be used to convey information as the participants could accurately (91\&\#x2014;97\%) recognize individual characters. In the second experiment the presentation rate of the most efficient and preferred method, the rhythm, was varied. A mean recognition accuracy of 70\% was found when the speed of presenting a single character was nearly doubled from the first experiment. The results showed that temporal tactile feedback and Braille coding can be used to transmit single-character information while further studies are still needed to evaluate the presentation of serial information, i.e., multiple Braille characters.},

  abstract = {The gravitational field of a laser pulse of finite lifetime, is investigated in the framework of linearized gravity. Although the effects are very small, they may be of fundamental physical interest. It is shown that the gravitational field of a linearly polarized light pulse is modulated as the norm of the corresponding electric field strength, while no modulations arise for circular polarization. In general, the gravitational field is independent of the polarization direction. It is shown that all physical effects are confined to spherical shells expanding with the speed of light, and that these shells are imprints of the spacetime events representing emission and absorption of the pulse. Nearby test particles at rest are attracted towards the pulse trajectory by the gravitational field due to the emission of the pulse, and they are repelled from the pulse trajectory by the gravitational field due to its absorption. Examples are given for the size of the attractive effect. It is recovered that massless test particles do not experience any physical effect if they are co-propagating with the pulse, and that the acceleration of massless test particles counter-propagating with respect to the pulse is four times stronger than for massive particles at rest. The similarities between the gravitational effect of a laser pulse and Newtonian gravity in two dimensions are pointed out. The spacetime curvature close to the pulse is compared to that induced by gravitational waves from astronomical sources.},

They term this class of devices optical cavity thermionic emitters (OCTET). The devices consist of a microfabricated optical cavity, such as Fabry\textendash Perot or ring resonator, and a heterostructured thermionic emitter with a small bandgap or metallic thermionic emitter (e.g., LaB6) deposited on a wider bandgap electrical and thermal conductor (e.g., doped Si). By tuning the resonant wavelength of the optical cavity, the authors can ensure photons are efficiently and selectively absorbed by the small bandgap/metallic emitter, enabling design of gigahertz\textendash terahertz regime on-chip electron emission sources. The work here focuses on elucidating the properties of single cavity-single emitter OCTETs, but may be applied to more complex cavity-tip structures. First, the authors establish fundamental design rules based solely on the cavity optical properties and emitter optical and thermal properties. Next, detailed device simulations are carried out using optical and thermal three dimensional numerical simulations that accurately account for both geometry as well as temperature and wavelength dependent materials properties. The authors illustrate that devices with highly efficient photon to thermal conversion efficiencies \&gt;60\% can be achieved despite small emitter active absorption volumes \&lt;0.01 {$\mu$}m3 and moderate Q optical cavities. Critically, OCTETs may be designed with ultrafast subnanosecond thermal response time, and sub-10 ps current response times, or efficient steady state excitation\textemdash with \&lt;10 {$\mu$}W of power required to achieve nanoampere level current emission per tip. Importantly, due to the recent advances in integrated photonics and electronics, the structures explored here may be fabricated using standard microfabrication techniques.},

  abstract = {Although plasmas produced by lasers have been the subject of intense study over the past 40 years, those that are being considered as sources for EUVL offer new challenges in both design and understanding. The requirements of these sources are unique relative to other interests and applications of laser plasmas. EUVL demands a source that emits strong radiation only in one radiation band. The plasma must be small and be stable in position and light emission. It must be a high-repetition-rate source to satisfy dose stability. Moreover, strong consideration must be given to constraining the particulate and ion emission from the source: protecting the EUV illumination optics from degradation or erosion for long exposure times is one of the principal challenges. This combination of requirements forces consideration of features of laser plasmas outside the focus of most studies. They pose new challenges in the understanding, characterization, and design of laser plasmas. This chapter addresses one of these challenges. The EUV roadmap requires a bright source in a narrow spectral band in the vicinity of a 13-nm wavelength. This wavelength and the width of the spectral band ({$\approx$}0.26 nm) are set by the characteristics of the collection and imaging optics employed. The brightness required, which can be expressed in several ways [115 W of inband radiation at {$\approx$}13.5 nm, 2\% bandwidth, at the intermediate focus (IF), or perhaps, more fundamentally, {$\approx$}400 W of inband radiation within 2{$\pi$}sr at the source], challenges the limits of laser and laser-plasma technology. Laser plasmas emit radiation that is both characteristic of the plasma conditions and characteristic of the excited ion states created in the plasma. In satisfying the needs for a source, our challenge from a theoretical viewpoint is to understand and model this emission, at least under conditions that are likely to satisfy the intense brightness requirement in a practical system. It is for these reasons that in this chapter we concentrate on laser plasmas that have characteristics conducive to the creation of high-brightness, high-repetition-rate point EUV sources. We focus on the theory of laser-light interaction, plasma expansion, and radiant emission, seeking plasmas that are most likely to meet these needs. Thus we consider here spherical, 1D models of laser plasmas dominated by inverse bremsstrahlung absorption (IBA), thermal excitation, and classical energy transport. We focus on plasmas formed from ions that have strong emission lines in the 13-nm region. There are several candidates, including Li, O, Xe, Sn, and others. Low-Z materials such as Li and O have been examined in previous studies, and are now thought to be incapable of providing sufficient emission, or to be too impractical as a source. Here we examine mostly emission from so-called unresolved transition arrays (UTAs), tightly packed emission lines from multitudes of excited-state transitions in multiple ions in materials such as Xe and Sn. Theoretically this is a very challenging problem. Not only does it require a thorough understanding of the plasma state, but more important, and much more difficult to model, is the understanding of the detailed radiation transfer from all these transitions. To our knowledge this has not yet been accomplished completely. Thus, this chapter is a report on progress toward this end.},

A consequence of the uncertainly principle is that particles or energy can come into existence for a fleeting moment. Such vacuum or quantum fluctuations are known to exist, but evidence for them has been indirect. Riek et al. present an ultrafast optical based technique that probes the vacuum fluctuation of electromagnetic radiation directly. Science, this issue p. 420 The ground state of quantum systems is characterized by zero-point motion. This motion, in the form of vacuum fluctuations, is generally considered to be an elusive phenomenon that manifests itself only indirectly. Here, we report direct detection of the vacuum fluctuations of electromagnetic radiation in free space. The ground-state electric-field variance is inversely proportional to the four-dimensional space-time volume, which we sampled electro-optically with tightly focused laser pulses lasting a few femtoseconds. Subcycle temporal readout and nonlinear coupling far from resonance provide signals from purely virtual photons without amplification. Our findings enable an extreme time-domain approach to quantum physics, with nondestructive access to the quantum state of light. Operating at multiterahertz frequencies, such techniques might also allow time-resolved studies of intrinsic fluctuations of elementary excitations in condensed matter.

  abstract = {Squeezed states of electromagnetic radiation have quantum fluctuations below those of the vacuum field. They offer a unique resource for quantum information systems and precision metrology, including gravitational wave detectors, which require unprecedented sensitivity. Since the first experiments on this non-classical form of light, quantum analysis has been based on homodyning techniques and photon correlation measurements. These methods currently function in the visible to near-infrared and microwave spectral ranges. They require a well-defined carrier frequency, and photons contained in a quantum state need to be absorbed or amplified. Quantum non-demolition experiments may be performed to avoid the influence of a measurement in one quadrature, but this procedure comes at the expense of increased uncertainty in another quadrature. Here we generate mid-infrared time-locked patterns of squeezed vacuum noise. After propagation through free space, the quantum fluctuations of the electric field are studied in the time domain using electro-optic sampling with few-femtosecond laser pulses. We directly compare the local noise amplitude to that of bare (that is, unperturbed) vacuum. Our nonlinear approach operates off resonance and, unlike homodyning or photon correlation techniques, without absorption or amplification of the field that is investigated. We find subcycle intervals with noise levels that are substantially less than the amplitude of the vacuum field. As a consequence, there are enhanced fluctuations in adjacent time intervals, owing to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, which indicate generation of highly correlated quantum radiation. Together with efforts in the far infrared, this work enables the study of elementary quantum dynamics of light and matter in an energy range at the boundary between vacuum and thermal background conditions.},

Taken together, the experimental results, the theoretical calculations, and the results of the simulations indicate that thermionic emission from nonequilibrium electron heating provides the dominant source of the emitted electrons.

\item Wouldn't this destroy the substrate at these energies?

In most of these applications, light is considered in terms of electromagnetic plane waves propagating at the speed of light in vacuum. As a result, light\textendash matter interactions can usually be treated as very weak and captured at the lowest order in quantum electrodynamics. However, progress in understanding the coupling of photons to material quasiparticles (plasmons, phonons and excitons) brings the need for a generalized view of the photon at the core of every light\textendash matter interaction. In this new picture, the photon can have greatly different polarization and dispersion and be confined to the scale of a few nanometres. Such photonic quasiparticles enable a wealth of otherwise unobservable light\textendash matter interaction phenomena, in interactions with both bound and free electrons. This Review focuses on the theoretical and experimental developments in realizing new light\textendash matter interactions with photonic quasiparticles. Examples include room-temperature strong coupling, ultrafast `forbidden' transitions in atoms and new applications of the Cherenkov effect, as well as breakthroughs in ultrafast electron microscopy and new concepts for compact X-ray sources.},

In principle, the electron can relax from the excited state to any unoccupied lower energy level. In practice, however, most of these transitions are too slow and so are effectively forbidden. Rivera et al. show theoretically that the plasmonic excitations associated with two-dimensional materials can be used to enhance and control the light-matter interaction. Transitions that were once considered forbidden can thus be accessed, opening up the entire spectrum of an optical emitter. Science, this issue p. 263 The diversity of light-matter interactions accessible to a system is limited by the small size of an atom relative to the wavelength of the light it emits, as well as by the small value of the fine-structure constant. We developed a general theory of light-matter interactions with two-dimensional systems supporting plasmons. These plasmons effectively make the fine-structure constant larger and bridge the size gap between atom and light. This theory reveals that conventionally forbidden light-matter interactions\textemdash such as extremely high-order multipolar transitions, two-plasmon spontaneous emission, and singlet-triplet phosphorescence processes\textemdash can occur on very short time scales comparable to those of conventionally fast transitions. Our findings may lead to new platforms for spectroscopy, sensing, and broadband light generation, a potential testing ground for quantum electrodynamics (QED) in the ultrastrong coupling regime, and the ability to take advantage of the full electronic spectrum of an emitter. The emission spectrum of an optical emitter can be enhanced by coupling to two-dimensional materials.

Thus, there is a need to develop quantitative theories of QED phenomena in complex electronic and photonic systems. In this Letter, we develop a variational theory of general non-relativistic QED systems of coupled light and matter. Essential to our Ansatz is the notion of an effective photonic vacuum whose modes are different than the modes in the absence of light-matter coupling. This variational formulation leads to a set of general equations that can describe the ground state of multielectron systems coupled to many photonic modes in real space. As a first step toward a new ab initio approach to ground and excited state energies in QED, we apply our Ansatz to describe a multilevel emitter coupled to many optical modes, a system with no analytical solution. We find a compact semianalytical formula which describes ground and excited state energies very well in all regimes of coupling parameters allowed by sum rules. Our formulation provides a nonperturbative theory of Lamb shifts and Casimir-Polder forces, as well as suggest new physical concepts such as the Casimir energy of a single atom in a cavity. Our method thus give rise to highly accurate nonperturbative descriptions of many other phenomena in general QED systems.},

It is a method for calculating the phase relationships among different parts of a scattered wave disturbance in a situation where only the magnitude (intensity or flux) of the wave can be physically measured. Its usefulness lies in its ability (like holography) to obtain images without the use of lenses, and hence to lead to resolution improvements and access to properties of the scattering medium that cannot be easily obtained from conventional imaging methods. The chapter discusses ptychography in the context of other phase-retrieval methods in both historical and conceptual terms. In an original and oblique approach to the phase problem, it was Hoppe who proposed the first version of the particular solution to the phase problem. The word ``ptychography'' was introduced to suggest a solution to the phase problem using the convolution theorem, or rather the ``folding'' of diffraction orders into one another via the convolution of the Fourier transform of a localized aperture or illumination function in the object plane. Apart from computers, the two most important experimental issues that affect ptychography, relate to the degree of coherence in the illuminating beam and the detector efficiency and dynamic range.},

NLTL-gated sampling circuits for signal measurement have attained over 700-GHz bandwidth. Soliton propagation on NLTL's is used for picosecond impulse generation and broadband millimeter-wave frequency multiplication. Picosecond pulses can also be generated on traveling-wave structures loaded by resonant tunneling diodes. Applications include integration of photodetectors with sampling circuits for picosecond optical waveform measurements and instrumentation for millimeter-wave waveform and network (circuit) measurements both on-wafer and in free space. General properties of linear and nonlinear distributed devices and circuits are reviewed, including gain-bandwidth limits, dispersive and nondispersive propagation, shock-wave formation, and soliton propagation.{$<<$}ETX{$>>$}},

Unlike the well-known Volkov solutions that can be used only for fields of the plane-wave type, the wave functions obtained here are appropriate for the wider class of fields for which the different modes need not all have the same direction of propagation. This generalization allows in principle for the construction of wave packets, fields that are localized in space as well as time and hence capable of providing a more realistic description. The treatment of the nonrelativistic case is essentially exact, in the sense that errors introduced, of order (v/c)2, are comparable to those inherent in the nonrelativistic approximation. As an illustration, a low-frequency approximation for potential scattering in a multimode field is derived based on the use of the generalized Volkov solutions as asymptotic wave functions. Generalized Volkov solutions of the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations are derived as well, though here in an approximation requiring a limitation on the strength of the external field.},

Here, we investigate the potential of the metasurface near-field profile, generated by an incident few-cycle pulse laser, to facilitate the generation of high-frequency light from free electrons. In particular, the metasurface near-field contains higher-order spatial harmonics that can be leveraged to generate multiple higher-harmonic X-ray frequency peaks. We show that the X-ray spectral profile can be arbitrarily shaped by controlling the metasurface geometry, the electron energy, and the incidence angle of the laser input. Using ab initio simulations, we predict bright and monoenergetic X-rays, achieving energies of 30\,keV (with harmonics spaced by 3\,keV) from 5-MeV electrons using 3.4-eV plasmon polaritons on a metasurface with a period of 85\,nm. As an example, we present the design of a four-color X-ray source, a potential candidate for tabletop multicolor hard X-ray spectroscopy.

It also offers a simple and intuitive interface as well as an object oriented architecture that allows you to tweak anything within a figure. Finally, it can be used as a regular graphic library in order to design non-scientific figures. This book is organized into four parts. The first part considers the fundamental principles of the Matplotlib library. This includes reviewing the different parts that constitute a figure, the different coordinate systems, the available scales and projections, and we'll also introduce a few concepts related to typography and colors. The second part is dedicated to the actual design of a figure. After introducing some simple rules for generating better figures, we'll then go on to explain the Matplotlib defaults and styling system before diving on into figure layout organization. We'll then explore the different types of plot available and see how a figure can be ornamented with different elements.

  abstract = {The high peak electric fields provided by single-cycle light pulses can be harnessed to manipulate and control charge motion in solid-state systems, resulting in electron emission out of metals and semiconductors or high harmonics generation in dielectrics. These processes are of a non-perturbative character and require precise reproducibility of the electric-field profile. Here, we vary the carrier-envelope phase of 6-fs-long near-infrared pulses with pJ-level energy to control electronic transport in a laterally confined nanoantenna with an 8 nm gap. Peak current densities of 50 MA cm\textendash 2 are achieved, corresponding to the transfer of individual electrons in a half-cycle period of 2 fs. The observed behaviours are made possible by the strong distortion of the effective tunnelling barrier due to the extreme electric fields that the nanostructure provides and sustains under sub-cycle optical biasing. Operating at room temperature and in a standard atmosphere, the performed experiments demonstrate a robust class of nanoelectronic switches gated by phase-locked optical transients of minute energy content.},

The analysis of the measured traces reveals energy-dependent time delays of a few tens of attoseconds with high energy resolution. In contrast to photoelectrons ejected through tunneling, single-photon ionization can be well described in the framework of Wigner time delays. Accordingly, the overall trend of our data is reproduced by recent Wigner time delay calculations. However, besides the general trend we observe resonance features occurring at specific photon energies. These features have been qualitatively reproduced and identified by a calculation using the multiconfigurational Hartree-Fock method, including the influence of doubly excited states and ionization thresholds.},

Optomechanical systems are utilized to introduce coupling between the optical and microwave cavity modes. However, due to some restrictions of the optomechanical system, especially sensitivity to the thermal photon noise at room temperature, an alternative optoelectronic system is designed to address the problem. We study a method by which it may be possible to remove the mechanical part of the previous systems to minimize the thermally generated photons. Unlike optomechanical systems, in our system, the optical mode is directly coupled to the microwave cavity mode through the optoelectronic elements without employing any mechanical parts. The utilized approach leads to generating the entangled modes at room temperature. For this purpose, the dynamics of the motion of the optoelectronic system is theoretically derived using the Heisenberg-Langevin equations from which one can calculate the coupling between optical and microwave cavity modes. The direct coupling between the optical and microwave cavity modes is the most important feature and is achieved through the combination of the photodetector and a Varactor diode. Hence, by controlling the photodetector current, that is, the photocurrent, depending on the optical cavity incident wave and the Varactor diode-biased voltage, the coupling between the optical and microwave cavity modes is established. The voltage across the Varactor diode also depends on the generated photocurrent. Consequently, our results show that the coupled modes are entangled at room temperature without the requirement for any mechanical parts.},

This superposition is generally not fully coherent and must be described in terms of a density matrix. A recent experiment [E. Goulielmakis et al., Nature (London) 466, 739 (2010)] employed attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy to determine the density matrix of strong-field-generated Kr+ ions. The experimentally observed degree of coherence of the strong-field-generated Kr+ ions is well reproduced by a recently developed multichannel strong-field-ionization theory, but there is significant disagreement between experiment and theory with respect to the degree of alignment of the Kr+ ions. In the present paper, the theory underlying attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy of strong-field-generated ions is developed. The theory is formulated in such a way that the nonperturbative nature of the strong-field-ionization process is systematically taken into account. The impact of attosecond pulse propagation effects on the interpretation of experimental data is investigated both analytically and numerically. It is shown that attosecond pulse propagation effects cannot explain why the experimentally determined degree of alignment of strong-field-generated Kr+ ions is much smaller than predicted by existing theory.},

We compare the results of these SPNs with inverted SPN structures that consist of gold nanoantenna structures surrounded by a layer of vanadium dioxide (VO2) on their outer surface. These nanoantennas demonstrate switching of electric-field intensity enhancement (EFIE) between two states (On and Off states), which can be induced thermally, optically or electrically. The On and Off states of the nanoantennas correspond to the metallic and semiconductor states, respectively of the VO2 film inside or around the nanoantennas, as the VO2 film exhibits phase transition from its semiconductor state to the metallic state upon application of thermal, optical, or electrical energy. We employ finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations to demonstrate switching in the EFIE for four different SPN geometries \&\#x2014; nanorod-dipole, bowtie, planar trapezoidal toothed log-periodic, and rod-disk \&\#x2014; and compare their near-field distributions for the On and Off states of the SPNs.

  abstract = {We present the utility of 2-D electronic spectroscopy for the investigation of energy transfer dynamics in photosynthetic light-harvesting systems. Elucidating ultrafast energy transfer within photosynthetic systems is difficult due to the large number of molecules and complex environments involved in the process. In many spectroscopic methods, these systems appear as overlapping peaks with broad linewidths, obscuring the details of the dynamics. 2-D spectroscopy is a nonlinear, ultrafast method that yields a correlation map between excitation and emission energies, and can track incoherent and coherent energy transfer processes with femtosecond resolution. A 2-D spectrum can provide important insight into the structure and the mechanisms behind the excited state dynamics. We review the principles behind 2-D spectroscopy and describe the content of a 2-D electronic spectrum. Several recent applications of this technique to the major light-harvesting complex of Photosystem II are presented, including monitoring the time scales of energy transfer processes, investigation of the excited state energies, and determination of the relative orientations of the excited state transition dipole moments.},

While some samples were contacted by Ti/Au electrodes, another set of samples was investigated using a manipulator tip in a low energy electron point-source microscope. The deduced resistivities range from 1 to 103 Ocm. Additionally, the resistivities of nanowires from multiple publications were brought together and compared to the values obtained from our measurements. The overview of all data shows enormous differences (10[?]3-105 Ocm) in the measured resistivities. In order to reveal the origin of the discrepancies, the influence of growth parameters, measuring methods, contact resistances, crystal structures and ambient conditions are investigated and discussed in detail.}

Here, we present the results of a poll carried out among 33 participants of a conference on the foundations of quantum mechanics. The participants completed a questionnaire containing 16 multiple-choice questions probing opinions on quantum-foundational issues. Participants included physicists, philosophers, and mathematicians. We describe our findings, identify commonly held views, and determine strong, medium, and weak correlations between the answers.

Without much effort, it can be grown in many different nanoscale forms, thus allowing various novel devices to be achieved. We review recent studies of ZnO nanostructures, fabrication, novel device applications, and its potential as an electron-acceptor material in hybrid solar cells.

In doing so, we demonstrate how the diverse implementations of SPDC can be understood through a single common framework, and use this to derive straightforward formulas for the biphoton generation rate (pairs per second) in a variety of different circumstances. In particular, we consider the common cases of both collimated and focused Gaussian pump beams in a bulk nonlinear crystal, as well as in nonlinear waveguides and micro-ring resonators. Furthermore, we examine the number statistics of down-converted light using a non-perturbative approximation (the multi-mode squeezed vacuum), to provide quantitative formulas for the relative likelihood of multi-pair production events, and explore how the quantum state of the pump affects the subsequent statistics of the down-converted light. Following this, we consider the limits of the undepleted pump approximation, and conclude by performing experiments to test the effectiveness of our theoretical predictions for the biphoton generation rate in a variety of different sources.},

In the first interaction region (the modulator), an energy modulation is imprinted on the electron pulse. During free propagation, this energy modulation evolves into a charge density modulation, which we probe in the second interaction region (the analyzer). These results will lead to new ways of probing ultrafast dynamics in matter and are essential for future laser-based particle accelerators on a photonic chip.},

One central goal is the characterization and manipulation of electromagnetic fields on the attosecond and nanometer scale. This has so far remained challenging both theoretically and experimentally. One major obstacle is the inhomogeneity of the electric fields. Below we present a general model, which allows the description of attosecond streaking in near-fields. It allows the classification into different regimes as well as the reconstruction of the electric fields at the surface. In addition, we discuss the case of parallel polarization of the streaking fields to the surface, which has so far not been considered for attosecond streaking from metallic surfaces. Finally, we review recent measurements of the electric field and response function of a gold nanotaper. Our results are highly relevant for future attosecond streaking experiments in inhomogeneous fields.},

Intense light pulses in the terahertz spectral range have opened fascinating vistas. Because terahertz photon energies are far below typical electronic interband resonances, a stable electromagnetic waveform may serve as a precisely adjustable bias. Novel quantum phenomena have been anticipated for terahertz amplitudes, reaching atomic field strengths. We exploit controlled (multi-)terahertz waveforms with peak fields of 72 MV cm-1 to drive coherent interband polarization combined with dynamical Bloch oscillations in semiconducting gallium selenide. These dynamics entail the emission of phase-stable high-harmonic transients, covering the entire terahertz-to-visible spectral domain between 0.1 and 675 THz. Quantum interference of different ionization paths of accelerated charge carriers is controlled via the waveform of the driving field and explained by a quantum theory of inter- and intraband dynamics. Our results pave the way towards all-coherent terahertz-rate electronics. View full text},

In particular, graphene-based transistors have developed rapidly and are now considered an option for post-silicon electronics. However, many details about the potential performance of graphene transistors in real applications remain unclear. Here I review the properties of graphene that are relevant to electron devices, discuss the trade-offs among these properties and examine their effects on the performance of graphene transistors in both logic and radiofrequency applications. I conclude that the excellent mobility of graphene may not, as is often assumed, be its most compelling feature from a device perspective. Rather, it may be the possibility of making devices with channels that are extremely thin that will allow graphene field-effect transistors to be scaled to shorter channel lengths and higher speeds without encountering the adverse short-channel effects that restrict the performance of existing devices. Outstanding challenges for graphene transistors include opening a sizeable and well-defined bandgap in graphene, making large-area graphene transistors that operate in the current-saturation regime and fabricating graphene nanoribbons with well-defined widths and clean edges.},

  abstract = {A systematic study was done in order to relate the current density J-applied field F characteristic variation with three emission mechanisms: thermionic, tunneling, and ballistic. All three are now effective during the field emission from cathodes with work function {$\Phi$} less than 2eV. The current density is computed using the transmission probability for an electron to cross the barrier between the electron sea of the cathode and the vacuum. The corresponding Schr\"odinger equation is solved by means of the self-consistent Lippmann-Schwinger equation, with values of the effective potential corrected with the image potential between the cathode and the anode, and resolved by spatial discretization. This method allows computing the exact current within a zero emitted current approximation. It fills the gap left by the former analytical and numerical resolutions. The ln(J/F2) vs (1/F) plot shows, from the very beginning of the electron emission, three zones for the current variation. The first zone, corresponding to low applied electric fields, is a nonlinear variation of the current specific to thermionic-field emission; it is followed by a second zone having a linear variation with a slope proportional to {$\Phi$}3/2 characteristic of the conventional Fowler-Nordheim field emission. The third zone, concerning high field values, indicated a current saturation behavior related to a field-induced ballistic emission.},

A frequency-comb light beam (a light source consisting of a broad range of evenly spaced wavelengths) interacted with a specially designed passive metasurface so that the beam could be rapidly ({$<$}8 picoseconds) swept over a broad angle (25\textdegree ). Such beam-steering capability could directly affect augmented and virtual reality systems. Science, this issue p. 374 The capability of on-chip wavefront modulation has the potential to revolutionize many optical device technologies. However, the realization of power-efficient phase-gradient metasurfaces that offer full-phase modulation (0 to 2{$\pi$}) and high operation speeds remains elusive. We present an approach to continuously steer light that is based on creating a virtual frequency-gradient metasurface by combining a passive metasurface with an advanced frequency-comb source. Spatiotemporal redirection of light naturally occurs as optical phase-fronts reorient at a speed controlled by the frequency gradient across the virtual metasurface. An experimental realization of laser beam steering with a continuously changing steering angle is demonstrated with a single metasurface over an angle of 25\textdegree{} in just 8 picoseconds. This work can support integrated-on-chip solutions for spatiotemporal optical control, directly affecting emerging applications such as solid-state light detection and ranging (LIDAR), three-dimensional imaging, and augmented or virtual systems. A metasurface array can rapidly sweep a beam of light over a wide angle. A metasurface array can rapidly sweep a beam of light over a wide angle.},

Resonantly enhanced HHG from hot spots in nanostructures is an attractive route to overcoming the well-known limitations of gases and bulk solids. Here, we demonstrate a nanoscale platform for highly efficient HHG driven by intense mid-infrared laser pulses: an ultra-thin resonant gallium phosphide (GaP) metasurface. The wide bandgap and the lack of inversion symmetry of the GaP crystal enable the generation of even and odd harmonics covering a wide range of photon energies between 1.3 and 3\,eV with minimal reabsorption. The resonantly enhanced conversion efficiency facilitates single-shot measurements that avoid material damage and pave the way to study the~controllable transition between perturbative and non-perturbative regimes of light-matter interactions at the nanoscale.},

The knowledge of these eigenfunctions makes the diffraction calculation not only simple and direct, but also devoid of the many limitations encountered in other solution techniques. In particular, diffraction from deep gratings and the calculation of surface-plasmon excitations present no difficulties. Numerical results on diffraction efficiency are in good agreement with our experimental data. The near-field electromagnetic properties of Ag gratings are examined in detail. These results are of particular importance in understanding the optical behavior of molecules near a rough metal surface (for example, in surface-enhanced Raman scattering). It is shown that coincident with the excitation of surface plasmon, there is an enhancement of the local- (surface-) field intensity by a factor of 100-500. For molecules on a grating surface, such increase in local fields can imply an amplification of 104-3\texttimes 105 for the Raman scattering signal.},

  abstract = {Optical Angular Selection A monochromatic electromagnetic plane wave is typically characterized by three properties: its frequency, its polarization, and its propagation direction. While the selection of light signals based on the first two properties has been studied in depth, selection based on direction is relatively unexplored but equally important. Shen et al. (p. 1499) demonstrate a simple approach that provides narrow-angle selectivity over a broad range of wavelengths using heterostructured photonic crystals that act as a mirror for all but a narrow range of viewing angles where the crystals are transparent. Such angular selection should find a number of applications in, for example, high efficiency solar energy conversion, privacy protection systems, or high signal-to-noise detectors. Light selection based purely on the angle of propagation is a long-standing scientific challenge. In angularly selective systems, however, the transmission of light usually also depends on the light frequency. We tailored the overlap of the band gaps of multiple one-dimensional photonic crystals, each with a different periodicity, in such a way as to preserve the characteristic Brewster modes across a broadband spectrum. We provide theory as well as an experimental realization with an all\textendash visible spectrum, p-polarized angularly selective material system. Our method enables transparency throughout the visible spectrum at one angle\textemdash the generalized Brewster angle\textemdash and reflection at every other viewing angle. A photonic crystal heterostructure is designed to provide optical selection based on propagation direction.

The enhancement factor is of the same order of magnitude as the number of electrons in a bunch. The intensity decreases with the increase of the beam height, or the distance of the beam from the grating, and the dependence on the beam height is expressed approximately by the modified Bessel function of the zeroth order. Owing to a relativistic effect the radiation is emitted in a narrow direction along the plane normal to the grating. The intensity of the radiation varies in a periodic way when the groove depth of the grating was changed. The observed properties of radiation are explained well by a three-dimensional theory of Smith-Purcell radiation, in which the coherence effect due to bunched electrons is taken into account.},

Here we demonstrate the real-space imaging of the (projected) atomic electric field distribution inside single Au atoms, using sub-\AA{} spatial resolution STEM combined with a high-speed segmented detector. We directly visualize that the electric field distribution (blurred by the sub-\AA{} size electron probe) drastically changes within the single Au atom in a shape that relates to the spatial variation of total charge density within the atom. Atomic-resolution electric field mapping with single-atom sensitivity enables us to examine their detailed internal and boundary structures.},

A microneedle and a microheater are formed on the diaphragm and plate of each actuator, respectively. The sealed cavity is filled with an operating liquid. Activating the heater and generating bubbles, which is similar to the process of a thermal ink jet, increase the pressure in the cavity. As a result, the flexible membrane deforms and it drives the needle upwards to stimulate receptors. Microelectromechanical systems technologies are used to fabricate the three components of the actuators, which are manually assembled to form a 3 \texttimes{} 3 arrayed actuator device.

Here, we use a refractive silicon nitride thin film to tackle the second of Scherzer's constraints and demonstrate an alternative method for correcting spherical aberration in a scanning transmission electron microscope. We reveal features in Si and Cu samples that cannot be resolved in an uncorrected microscope.

DLSPPW circuits are built around NV containing nanodiamonds, which are certified to be single-photon emitters, using electron-beam lithography of hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) resist on silver-coated silicon substrates. A propagation length of 20 {$\pm$} 5 {$\mu$}m for the NV single-photon emission is measured with DLSPPWs. A 5-fold enhancement in the total decay rate, and 58\% coupling efficiency to the DLSPPW mode is achieved, indicating significant mode confinement. Finally, we demonstrate routing of single plasmons with DLSPPW-based directional couplers, revealing the potential of our approach for on-chip realization of quantum-optical networks.},

While once limited to only a handful of well-funded research institutions, the advent of technologies such as affordable wide-bandgap laser diodes and field programmable analog arrays (FPGAs) has opened the door to these experiments being feasible for classroom and hobbyist settings. In this report, we first review a few classic quantum setups, such as quantum key distribution, bell-state measurements, and entanglement-assisted measure- ments. Next, we survey various enabling technologies for such experiments such as lasers, non-linear crystals, single photon detectors, and FPGAs and extract relevant real-world parameters, and fig- ure out how each experiment could be realized conceptually. An original goal of this work was to calculate how the real behavior of these components limit the throughput and practicality of such experiments, though due to space considerations this is left to future work.},

An alternative approach for reaching the required field intensities is offered by localized optical resonances such as plasmons. Here, we demonstrate localized multiphoton photoemission from plasmonic nanostructures under continuous-wave illumination. We use synthesized plasmonic gold nanostars, which exhibit sharp tips with structural features smaller than 5 nm, leading to near-field-intensity enhancements exceeding 1000. This large enhancement facilitates 3-photon photoemission driven by a simple continuous-wave laser diode. We characterize the intensity and polarization dependencies of the photoemission yield from both individual nanostars and ensembles. Numerical simulations of the plasmonic enhancement, the near-field distributions, and the photoemission intensities are in good agreement with experiment.

For example, tremendous excitement was sparked by reports of nanostructure-enhanced high-harmonic generation. However, there is growing tension between the great promise held by extreme-ultraviolet and attosecond-pulse generation on the nanoscale, and the lack of successful implementations. Here, we address this problem in a study of highly nonlinear optical processes in gas-exposed bow-tie nanoantennas. We find multiphoton- and strong-field-induced atomic excitation and ionization resulting in extreme-ultraviolet fluorescence, as well as third- and fifth-harmonic generation intrinsic to the nanostructures. Identifying the intensity-dependent spectral fingerprint of atomic fluorescence, we gauge local plasmonic fields. Whereas intensities sufficient for high-harmonic generation are indeed achieved in the near-field, the nanoscopic volume is found to prohibit an efficient conversion. Our results illustrate opportunities and challenges in highly nonlinear plasmonics and its extension to the extreme ultraviolet. View full text},

The results present the possibility of developing solid-state ultrafast optical devices. Science, this issue p. 303 The advent of high-harmonic generation in gases 30 years ago set the foundation for attosecond science and facilitated ultrafast spectroscopy in atoms, molecules, and solids. We explore high-harmonic generation in the solid state by means of nanostructured and ion-implanted semiconductors. We use wavelength-selective microscopic imaging to map enhanced harmonic emission and show that the generation medium and the driving field can be locally tailored in solids by modifying the chemical composition and morphology. This enables the control of high-harmonic technology within precisely engineered solid targets. We demonstrate customized high-harmonic wave fields with wavelengths down to 225 nanometers (ninth-harmonic order of 2-micrometer laser pulses) and present an integrated Fresnel zone plate target in silicon, which leads to diffraction-limited self-focusing of the generated harmonics down to 1-micrometer spot sizes. Nanofabricated structures and chemical composition can tune the generation of high harmonics from solid-state targets.

  abstract = {Time-resolved electron diffraction harbors great promise for resolving the fastest chemical processes with atomic level detail. The main obstacles to achieving this real-time view of a chemical reaction are associated with delivering short electron pulses with sufficient electron density to the sample. In this article, the propagation dynamics of femtosecond electron packets in the drift region of a photoelectron gun are investigated with an N-body numerical simulation and mean-fieldmodel. It is found that space-charge effects can broaden the electron pulse to many times its original length and generate many eV of kinetic energy bandwidth in only a few nanoseconds. There is excellent agreement between the N-body simulation and the mean-fieldmodel for both space-charge induced temporal and kinetic energy distribution broadening. The numerical simulation also shows that the redistribution of electrons inside the packet results in changes to the pulse envelope and the development of a spatially linear axial velocity distribution. These results are important for (or have the potential to impact on) the interpretation of time-resolved electron diffractionexperiments and can be used in the design of photoelectron guns and streak tubes with temporal resolution of several hundred femtoseconds.},

It is shown that the SPPs can be recovered from the idealized fields by well-known perturbation techniques. The emitted radiation is strongly concentrated into a narrow solid angle near the cone boundary for cones with a small opening angle. We calculate that, using currently available technology, subpicosecond SPPs with peak electric fields of the order of MV/cm on a 1 mm diameter wire can be obtained.}

When the laser field drives the wavepackets back to the parent ion, they interfere with the bound wavefunction, producing coherent subfemtosecond extreme-ultraviolet light bursts. When only a single return is possible2,3, an isolated attosecond pulse is generated. Here we demonstrate that by modulating the polarization of a carrier-envelope phase-stabilized short laser pulse4, we can finely control the electron-wavepacket dynamics. We use high-order harmonic generation to probe these dynamics. Under optimized conditions, we observe the signature of a single return of the electron wavepacket over a large range of energies. This temporally confines the extreme-ultraviolet emission to an isolated attosecond pulse with a broad and tunable bandwidth. Our approach is very general, and extends the bandwidth of attosecond isolated pulses in such a way that pulses of a few attoseconds seem achievable. Similar temporal resolution could also be achieved by directly using the broadband electron wavepacket. This opens up a new regime for time-resolved tomography of atomic or molecular wavefunctions5,6 and ultrafast~dynamics.},

Nonlinear optical polarization1,2 produces coherent radiation in spectral ranges inaccessible by lasers and constitutes the key to ultimate-speed signal manipulation. Terahertz techniques3,4,5,6,7,8 have provided experimental access to this important observable up to frequencies of several terahertz9,10,11,12,13. Here we demonstrate that attosecond metrology14 extends the resolution to petahertz frequencies of visible light. Attosecond polarization spectroscopy allows measurement of the response of the electronic system of silica to strong (more than one volt per \aa ngstr\"om) few-cycle optical (about 750 nanometres) fields. Our proof-of-concept study provides time-resolved insight into the attosecond nonlinear polarization and the light\textendash matter energy transfer dynamics behind the optical Kerr effect and multi-photon absorption. Timing the nonlinear polarization relative to the driving laser electric field with sub-30-attosecond accuracy yields direct quantitative access to both the reversible and irreversible energy exchange between visible\textendash infrared light and electrons. Quantitative determination of dissipation within a signal manipulation cycle of only a few femtoseconds duration (by measurement and ab initio calculation) reveals the feasibility of dielectric optical switching at clock rates above 100 terahertz. The observed sub-femtosecond rise of energy transfer from the field to the material (for a peak electric field strength exceeding 2.5 volts per \aa ngstr\"om) in turn indicates the viability of petahertz-bandwidth metrology with a solid-state device.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the experimental observation of piezoelectric generation from a single ZnO wire/belt for illustrating a fundamental process of converting mechanical energy into electricity at nanoscale. By deflecting a wire/belt using a conductive atomic force microscope tip in contact mode, the energy is first created by the deflection force and stored by piezoelectric potential, and later converts into piezoelectric energy. The mechanism of the generator is a result of coupled semiconducting and piezoelectric properties of ZnO. A piezoelectric effect is required to create electric potential of ionic charges from elastic deformation; semiconducting property is necessary to separate and maintain the charges and then release the potential via the rectifying behavior of the Schottky barrier at the metalZnO interface, which serves as a switch in the entire process. The good conductivity of ZnO is rather unique because it makes the current flow possible. This paper demonstrates a principle for harvesting energy from the environment. The technology has the potential of converting mechanical movement energy (such as body movement, muscle stretching, blood pressure), vibration energy (such as acoustic/ultrasonic wave), and hydraulic energy (such as flow of body fluid, blood flow, contraction of blood vessels) into electric energy that may be sufficient for self-powering nanodevices and nanosystems in applications such as in situ, real-time, and implantable biosensing, biomedical monitoring, and biodetection.}

We utilize 8-fs supercontinuum pulses generated by gas filamentation spanning the entire visible region (450 \&\#x02013; 800 nm), which allows for a simultaneous interrogation of electronic transitions over a 200-nm bandwidth, and an all-reflective interferometric delay system with angled nanopositioner stages achieves interferometric precision in coherence time control without introducing wavelength-dependent dispersion to the ultrabroadband spectrum. To address deterioration of detection sensitivity due to the inherent instability of ultrabroadband sources, we introduce a 5-kHz shot-to-shot, dual chopping acquisition scheme by combining a high-speed line-scan camera and two optical choppers to remove scatter contributions from the signal. Comparison of 2D spectra acquired by shot-to-shot detection and averaged detection shows a 15-fold improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio. This is the first direct quantification of detection sensitivity on a filamentation-based ultrabroadband 2DES apparatus.},

For doping concentrations of 1020 cm-3 and 1021 cm-3, our dispersion calculations show that bound surface plasmon polaritons will propagate with low loss on stripe-shaped plasmonic waveguides over the 10 to 55 \textmu m and 2.8 to 15 \textmu m wavelength ranges, respectively. For Pd2Si/Si plasmonic waveguides, the wavelength range of 0.5 to 7.5 \textmu m is useful and here the propagation lengths are 1 to 2300 \textmu m. For both doped and silicided guides, the SPP mode field extends much more into the air above the stripe than it does into the conductive stripe material.},

These techniques are broadly classified as ex situ, where the attosecond pulse train photoionizes a target gas in the presence of an infrared field, and in situ, where the measurement takes place in the medium in which the attosecond pulses are generated. It is accepted that ex situ techniques measure the characteristics of the electromagnetic field, including the phase of the recombination transition moment of the emitting atom or molecule, when the phase of the second medium is known. However, there is debate about whether in situ techniques measure the electromagnetic field, or only the characteristics of the recolliding electron before recombination occurs. We show numerically that in situ measurements are not sensitive to the recombination phase, when implemented in the perturbative regime as originally envisioned, and that they do not measure the electromagnetic phase of the emission.},

  abstract = {The availability of EUV light sources, measurement tools, and integrated test systems is of major importance for the development of EUVL to be used in high-volume chip manufacturing, which is expected to start in 2009. For economic use of EUVL, a throughput of 100 wafers per hour will be necessary, as estimated from the cost of an EUV exposure tool in combination with sophisticated throughput models. This means that light sources will be necessary that deliver an EUV output power of 115 W at 13.5 nm at the entrance of the illuminator system. The choice of the wavelength is derived from a general convention to use Mo/Si-based reflection coatings on the near-normal-incidence mirrors of the lithography system. The power specification in combination with the required lifetimes of source components and collector optics makes the source technology the most critical issue in developing EUVL. LPPs as sources for EUV radiation are a promising technical approach because of their physical principle, which allows one to manage the thermal load of source components to provide sufficient component lifetimes. As a result, the EUV output power seems to be scalable to high-volume manufacturing (HVM) requirements. At XTREME technologies GmbH\textemdash a joint venture of Lambda Physik AG, G\"ottingen, and Jenoptik LOS GmbH, Jena, Germany\textemdash EUV sources based on the generation of a plasma by an electrical gas discharge and by laser excitation have been investigated and developed since 2001.

  abstract = {Plasmonics is a rapidly developing field at the boundary of physical optics and condensed matter physics. It studies phenomena induced by and associated with surface plasmons\textemdash elementary polar excitations bound to surfaces and interfaces of good nanostructured metals. This Roadmap is written collectively by prominent researchers in the field of plasmonics. It encompasses selected aspects of nanoplasmonics. Among them are fundamental aspects, such as quantum plasmonics based on the quantum-mechanical properties of both the underlying materials and the plasmons themselves (such as their quantum generator, spaser), plasmonics in novel materials, ultrafast (attosecond) nanoplasmonics, etc. Selected applications of nanoplasmonics are also reflected in this Roadmap, in particular, plasmonic waveguiding, practical applications of plasmonics enabled by novel materials, thermo-plasmonics, plasmonic-induced photochemistry and photo-catalysis. This Roadmap is a concise but authoritative overview of modern plasmonics. It will be of interest to a wide audience of both fundamental physicists and chemists, as well as applied scientists and engineers.},

  abstract = {Recently, there has been an increased attention and rapid development in the field of nanoscale collective electronic dynamics on surfaces of metal nanostructures, which is due to excitations called surface plasmons (SPs). This field, known as nanoplasmonics, is very promising for such applications as the next generation optoelectronics, computations and information storage on the nanoscale, ultrasensitive detection of threats and spectroscopy of physical, chemical and biological nano-objects. Due to their broad spectral bandwidth, SPs possess ultrafast dynamics, with times as short as hundreds of attoseconds. In this paper, we discuss progress in the excitation, control and applications of the ultrafast nanoplasmonic fields. Special attention is devoted to attosecond visualization and coherent control of the nanoscale optical fields. Prospective applications of ultrafast nanoplasmonics are discussed.},

Until now, ODT has been limited to coherent light because spatial phase information is required to solve the inverse scattering problem. We introduce a method that enables ODT to be applied to imaging incoherent contrast mechanisms such as fluorescent emission. Our strategy mimics the coherent scattering process with two spatially coherent illumination beams. The interferometric illumination pattern encodes spatial phase in temporal variations of the fluorescent emission, thereby allowing incoherent fluorescent emission to mimic the behavior of coherent illumination. The temporal variations permit recovery of the spatial distribution of fluorescent emission with an inverse scattering model. Simulations and experiments demonstrate isotropic resolution in the 3D reconstruction of a fluorescent object.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate time-domain sampling of mid-infrared electric field transients and their conjugate counterparts exploiting the dynamical Pockels effect. To this end, the complete polarization change of few-femtosecond probe pulses is studied. An intuitive picture based on a phasor representation is established before gaining quantitative understanding in experiment and theory. In the standard version of electro-optic sampling, the electric field is determined by analyzing the change of ellipticity of the probe polarization. Beyond this, we find that a temporal gradient of the input electric field manifests itself in a rotation of the polarization ellipsoid of the probe. The relative contribution of sum- and difference-frequency mixing processes and their spectral distribution over the near-infrared probe bandwidth are identified as key aspects. If one of these processes dominates, detecting ellipticity changes and polarization rotation as a function of time delay results in two wave forms which are Hilbert transforms of each other. Such conditions may be achieved by angle phase matching in birefringent materials or spectral filtering of the probe after the nonlinear interaction. In this case, a static phase introduced by birefringence or reflection at metallic mirrors results in a specific phase shift of both time traces with respect to the input electric field. Contributions from sum- and difference-frequency generation are found to be equivalent when using electro-optic sensors with isotropic refractive index. Polarization rotations in the low- and high-frequency parts of the probe then tend to cancel out. In this limit, spurious additional phase shifts do not change the phase of the detected transients. This fact leads to a robust recovery of the carrier-envelope phase of the input wave form. Clarifying the role of imperfections of superachromatic phase retarders completes our survey on proper determination of the electric field and its conjugate variable.},

An understanding of the spatially resolved near-field properties and dynamics of LSPR is important, but remains experimentally challenging. We report experimental studies toward this aim using photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) with high spatial resolution of sub-10 nm. Various engineered gold nanostructure arrays (such as rods, nanodisk-like particles and dimers) are investigated via PEEM using near-infrared (NIR) femtosecond laser pulses as the excitation source. When the LSPR wavelengths overlap the spectrum of the femtosecond pulses, the LSPR is efficiently excited and promotes multiphoton photoemission, which is correlated with the local intensity of the metallic nanoparticles in the near field. Thus, the local field distribution of the LSPR on different Au nanostructures can be directly explored and discussed using the PEEM images. In addition, the dynamics of the LSPR is studied by combining interferometric time-resolved pump-probe technique and PEEM. Detailed information on the oscillation and dephasing of the LSPR field can be obtained. The results identify PEEM as a powerful tool for accessing the near-field mapping and dynamic properties of plasmonic nanostructures.},

In addition, RI contains rich information related to the metabolism of cells at the cellular and subcellular levels. Here, we report a no-moving parts approach that provides three-dimensional refractive index maps of biological samples continuously flowing in a microfluidic channel. Specifically, we use line illumination and off-axis digital holography to record the angular spectra of light scattered from flowing samples at high speed. Applying the scalar diffraction theory, we obtain accurate RI maps of the samples from the measured spectra. Using this method, we demonstrate label-free 3-D imaging of live RKO human colon cancer cells and RPMI8226 multiple myeloma cells, and obtain the volume, dry mass and density of these cells from the measured 3-D refractive index maps. Our results show that the reported method, alone or in combination with the existing flow cytometry techniques, promises as a quantitative tool for stain-free characterization of large number of cells.},

\begin{itemize}

\item Very similar to what I think we could do with the nonlinear antenna arrays if we went into imaging mode.

\item Advantages of the tip sensor:

\begin{itemize}

\item Back-side illumination is much easier configuration for measurments

\item The detection could include nonlinar information, not simply the linear refractive index response

\item It would be highly hyperspectral -- that would give much more molecular information without the need for tagging with fluorescent chemicals, even compared to what they do in this work

However, previous attempts to apply the relations to solutions of human hemoglobin have been somewhat controversial, resulting in disagreement between several studies. We show that this controversy can be resolved when careful attention is paid not only to the absorption of hemoglobin but also to the dispersion of the refractive index of the nonabsorbing solvent. We present a Kramers-Kroning analysis taking both contributions into account and compare the results with the data from several studies. Good agreement with experiments is found across the visible and parts of near-infrared and ultraviolet regions. These results reinstate the use of the Kramers-Kronig relations for hemoglobin solutions and provide an additional source of information about their refractive index.},

Induced by an optical switching signal, the amorphous dielectric with vanishing intrinsic {$\chi$}(2) develops dynamically tunable second-order nonlinear responses. By taking the second-harmonic generation as an example, we show that breaking the inversion symmetry through hot-electron dynamics can be leveraged to address the critical need for all-optical control of second-order nonlinearities in nanophotonics.

  note = {The possibility of using plasmonic nanoantennas in interaction with electron beams to form a wideband few-photon source is demonstrated here using numerical investigations. The generated photons are guided inside a waveguide, which is coupled to the nanoantennas. Using two replicas of a nanoantenna at an optimized distance, and providing a guided path for the emitted photon from the first nanoantenna to the second one by positioning a resonator feedback element, it is possible to form an interference between the photons generated by the two nanoantennas. The interference phenomenon is used to produce a unidirectional flow of power in the waveguide, as well as a high collection efficiency. The investigations are carried out in a self-consistent way, utilizing a conjugate Maxwell and Lorentz system of equations, in order to be able to simulate the modulation of the electron velocity due to the interaction with an optical system which is initially at rest.},

  abstract = {The generation of high-order harmonics from atomic and molecular gases enables the production of high-energy photons and ultrashort isolated pulses. Obtaining efficiently similar photon energy from solid-state systems could lead, for instance, to more compact extreme ultraviolet and soft x-ray sources. We demonstrate from ab initio simulations that it is possible to generate high-order harmonics from free-standing monolayer materials, with an energy cutoff similar to that of atomic and molecular gases. In the limit in which electrons are driven by the pump laser perpendicularly to the monolayer, they behave qualitatively the same as the electrons responsible for high-harmonic generation (HHG) in atoms, where their trajectories are described by the widely used semiclassical model, and exhibit real-space trajectories similar to those of the atomic case. Despite the similarities, the first and last steps of the well-established three-step model for atomic HHG are remarkably different in the two-dimensional materials from gases. Moreover, we show that the electron-electron interaction plays an important role in harmonic generation from monolayer materials because of strong local-field effects, which modify how the material is ionized. The recombination of the accelerated electron wave packet is also found to be modified because of the infinite extension of the material in the monolayer plane, thus leading to a more favorable wavelength scaling of the harmonic yield than in atomic HHG. Our results establish a novel and efficient way of generating high-order harmonics based on a solid-state device, with an energy cutoff and a more favorable wavelength scaling of the harmonic yield similar to those of atomic and molecular gases. Two-dimensional materials offer a unique platform where both bulk and atomic HHG can be investigated, depending on the angle of incidence. Devices based on two-dimensional materials can extend the limit of existing sources. Two-dimensional materials offer a unique platform where both bulk and atomic HHG can be investigated.

Moreover, we show that it is possible to predict the laser polarization for optimal HHG in bulk crystals solely from the knowledge of their electronic band structure.

By solving the semiconductor Bloch equation (SBE) in two dimensions, it is found that the HHG yields show a high sensitivity to the relative phase between the two fields. By changing the laser intensity, the yields of HHG show two maxima in the high-order region. To reveal the physical origin of these phenomena, we analyze the behavior of the electron-hole pair in the real and reciprocal spaces by the recollision model, respectively. It could qualitatively interpret the results by SBE simulations. Our analysis demonstrates that the OTC laser fields could control the electron-hole dynamics and HHG processes efficiently.},

In this region, the phase of the optical carrier with respect to the pulse envelope becomes important in nonlinear optical processes such as high-harmonic generation. Because there are no locking mechanisms between envelope and carrier inside a laser, their relative phase offset experiences random fluctuations. Here, we propose several novel methods to measure and to stabilize this carrier-envelope offset (CEO) phase with sub-femtosecond uncertainty. The stabilization methods are an important prerequisite for attosecond pulse generation schemes. Short and highly periodic pulses of a two-cycle laser correspond to an extremely wide frequency comb of equally spaced lines, which can be used for absolute frequency measurements. Using the proposed phase-measurement methods, it will be possible to phase-coherently link any unknown optical frequency within the comb spectrum to a primary microwave standard. Experimental studies using a sub-6-fs Ti:sapphire laser suggesting the feasibility of carrier-envelope phase control are presented.},

Extending this method to the millimetre-wave and terahertz-wave domains is of great interest. Dissipative Kerr solitons in integrated photonic chips offer the unique feature of delivering optical frequency combs with ultrahigh repetition rates from 10\,GHz to 1\,THz, making them relevant gears for performing optical frequency division in the millimetre-wave and terahertz-wave domains. We experimentally demonstrate the optical frequency division of an optically carried 3.6\,THz reference down to 300\,GHz through a dissipative Kerr soliton, photodetected with an ultrafast uni-travelling-carrier photodiode. A new measurement system, based on the characterization of a microwave reference phase locked to the 300\,GHz signal under test, yields attosecond-level timing-noise sensitivity, overcoming conventional technical limitations. This work places dissipative Kerr solitons as a leading technology in the millimetre-wave and terahertz-wave field, promising breakthroughs in fundamental and civilian applications.},

Despite decades of interest and effort, this portion of the electromagnetic spectrum remains challenging to cover with conventional laser technologies. In this paper, we present a simple and robust method for generating super-octave, optical frequency combs in the fingerprint region through intra-pulse difference frequency generation in an orientation-patterned gallium phosphide crystal. The attainable brightness from this tabletop source reaches the same level achievable by infrared synchrotron radiation with a bandwidth spanning from 4 to 12\&\#x00A0;\&\#x00B5;m. We demonstrate the utility of this unique coherent light source for high-precision, dual-frequency-comb spectroscopy of methanol and ethanol vapor. These results highlight the potential of laser frequency combs for a wide range of infrared molecular sensing applications from basic molecular spectroscopy to nanoscopic imaging.},

In some devices the noise spectrum is of the type Ieq = (Ia + A/f{$\alpha$}), whereas in other devices is of the type Ieq = (Ia12 + A12/f{$\alpha$}/2)2; in most cases {$\alpha$} is close to 32. The first type of noise can be interpreted as the result of two independent noise sources, excess noise and shot noise, speculations are made about the second typw of noise. In many cases the excess noise spectrum is levelling off below 10 cycles. The excess noise is interpreted in terms of work function fluctuations governed by a diffusion of atoms over the surface. This gives a 1/f32 spectrum at high frequencies whereas the spectrum levels off at low frequencies. The experimental turnover frequency agrees roughly with the theoretical predictions. The theory can also explain the temperature dependence of the field emission excess noise found by Kleint.},

Nanophotonics provides a platform to enhance the detection capability. Tittl et al. built a mid-IR nanophotonic sensor based on reflection from an all-dielectric metasurface array of specially designed scattering elements. The scattering elements could be tuned via geometry across a broad range of wavelengths in the mid-IR. The approach successfully detected and differentiated the absorption fingerprints of various molecules. The technique offers the prospect of on-chip molecular fingerprinting without the need for spectrometry, frequency scanning, or moving mechanical parts. Science, this issue p. 1105 Metasurfaces provide opportunities for wavefront control, flat optics, and subwavelength light focusing. We developed an imaging-based nanophotonic method for detecting mid-infrared molecular fingerprints and implemented it for the chemical identification and compositional analysis of surface-bound analytes. Our technique features a two-dimensional pixelated dielectric metasurface with a range of ultrasharp resonances, each tuned to a discrete frequency; this enables molecular absorption signatures to be read out at multiple spectral points, and the resulting information is then translated into a barcode-like spatial absorption map for imaging. The signatures of biological, polymer, and pesticide molecules can be detected with high sensitivity, covering applications such as biosensing and environmental monitoring. Our chemically specific technique can resolve absorption fingerprints without the need for spectrometry, frequency scanning, or moving mechanical parts, thereby paving the way toward sensitive and versatile miniaturized mid-infrared spectroscopy devices. A pixelated dielectric metasurface is used for the mid-infrared detection of molecular fingerprints.

The self-guided propagation, observed at the conditions of bright harmonic generation, was confirmed by the model calculations. When using negatively chirped pulses, the calculated distribution of the harmonic field is spatially and spectrally confined, being generated on axis with a narrow spectral profile. The positively chirped pulses generate broad spectral distribution on axis, and narrow off axis, but in the latter case with a large emission angle. The estimation of harmonic beam divergence agreed well with experimentally measured data, showing the lowest divergence at the conditions of the brightest harmonic generation. Spectral, temporal, and spatial modifications of the propagated laser pulse are found to influence decisively the single-atom response and ultimately the harmonic field, providing a coherent picture of harmonic generation.},

We report that when using focused high-intensity ultrashort laser pulses, this normally weak THG process becomes highly operative at a simple air-dielectric interface and is much stronger than the bulk of most dielectric materials. We characterized this nonlinear optical response at interfaces as a phenomenological surface-enhanced THG in transmission and/or in reflection. This surface THG is further cascaded in transmission or reflection from layered composite dielectric materials of a high-low index of refraction, resulting in a marked increase in photon conversion efficiency than that of a single interface. Although the present THG efficiency is lower than that of a typical phase-matching harmonic crystal, it is important to note that the surface-enhanced optical THG is a fundamental physical process occurring at all interfaces and is relatively free from the constraint of a phase-matching condition and wavelength restriction. Using optical THG at an interface, it becomes possible to generate wavelengths at which harmonic crystals are unavailable. These findings may lead to a new development of surface-enhanced studies and prompt a reexamination of the processes of high-harmonic generation at interfaces using a focused beam.},

A sequence of two laser interactions at an optimized propagation distance allows us to coherently control adjacent energy sidebands in amplitude and phase in the way of a qubit. The use of continuous-wave laser light provides these modulations at almost the full brightness of the beam source.

  abstract = {Recent advancements in nanofabrication have enabled the creation of vacuum electronic devices with nanoscale free space gaps. These nanoelectronic devices promise the benefits of cold-field emission and transport through free-space, such as high nonlinearity and relative insensitivity to temperature and ionizing radiation, all the while drastically reducing the footprint, increasing the operating bandwidth and reducing the power consumption of each device. Furthermore, planarized vacuum nanoelectronics could easily be integrated at scale similar to typical micro and nanoscale semiconductor electronics. However, the interplay between different electron emission mechanisms from these devices are not well understood, and inconsistencies with pure Fowler-Nordheim emission have been noted by others. In this work, we systematically study the current-voltage characteristics of planar vacuum nano-diodes having few-nanometer radii of curvature and free-space gaps between the emitter and collector. By investigating the current-voltage characteristics of nearly identical diodes fabricated from two different materials and under various environmental conditions, such as temperature and atmospheric pressure, we were able to clearly isolate three distinct emission regimes within a single device: Schottky, Fowler-Nordheim, and saturation. Our work will enable robust and accurate modeling of vacuum nanoelectronics which will be critical for future applications requiring high-speed and low-power electronics capable of operation in extreme conditions.},

A laser locked to such a narrow optical resonance could serve as a highly stable oscillator for an all-optical atomic clock. However, until recently there was no reliable clockwork mechanism that could count optical frequencies of hundreds of terahertz. Techniques using femtosecond-laser frequency combs, developed within the past few years, have solved this problem. The ability to count optical oscillations of more than 1015 cycles per second facilitates high-precision optical spectroscopy, and has led to the construction of an all-optical atomic clock that is expected eventually to outperform today's state-of-the-art caesium clocks.},

In this regime, new challenges are arising as the roles of band structure and coherent electron\textendash hole dynamics have yet to be resolved. Here, by using high-harmonic generation spectroscopy, we reveal the underlying attosecond dynamics that dictates the temporal evolution of carriers in multi-band solid-state systems. We demonstrate that when the electron\textendash hole relative velocity approaches zero, enhanced constructive interference leads to the appearance of spectral caustics in the high-harmonic generation spectrum. We introduce the role of the dynamical joint density of states and identify its mapping into the spectrum, which exhibits singularities at the spectral caustics. By studying these singularities, we probe the structure of multiple unpopulated high conduction bands.},

The experiments show that a much higher current density may be drawn from a short pulse or limited emitter area than is anticipated by the Child\textendash Langmuir limiting current. There is also evidence that the current may be increased even after virtual cathode formation, which leads a distinction between a limiting current density and a current density critical for virtual cathode formation. The experiments have also yielded some interesting results on the longitudinal structure of the current pulse passed through the anode. Some empirical and theoretical scaling laws regarding the formation of virtual cathodes in an electron gun will be presented.

A comparison of transmission and reflection geometries suggests that backward-propagating high-harmonics are an excellent reference to study nonlinear propagation of intense light in solids. Backward emission will enable phase matching of the high-harmonic beam and the integration of the functionalities of extended gas-phase high-harmonic beamlines into a single optical element.

This method offers a high degree of scalability to small length scales and a highly efficient manipulation of the electron vorticity with attosecond precision. Besides the direct implications in the investigation of nanoscale ultrafast processes in which chirality plays a major role, we further discuss the perspectives of using this technique to shape the wavefunction of charged composite particles, such as protons, and how it can be used to probe their internal structure.},

The name ``flicker noise'' refers to the noise phenomena with a spectrum of the form AI{$\beta$}/{$f\Elzpgamma$}, here A is a constant, I is the current, {$f$} is the frequency, and the exponents {$\beta$} and {$\gamma$} are also constants. The exponent {$\beta$} often has a value of about 2, though deviations are not uncommon. The theory of flicker noise as suppressed emission fluctuations cannot be valid, for in that case R, would be independent of d. Flicker partition noise indicates that the rate at which the current divides between the positive electrodes is randomly modulated by a I/{$f$}-type process. The noise is due to fluctuations in the surface recombination velocity s and that there is direct experimental evidence in favor of it.},

  abstract = {Ever since the inception of light microscopy, the laws of physics have seemingly thwarted every attempt to visualize the processes of life at its most fundamental, sub-cellular, level. The diffraction limit has restricted our view to length scales well above 250 nm and in doing so, severely compromised our ability to gain true insights into many biological systems. Fortunately, continuous advancements in optics, electronics and mathematics have since provided the means to once again make physics work to our advantage. Even though some of the fundamental concepts enabling super-resolution light microscopy have been known for quite some time, practically feasible implementations have long remained elusive. It should therefore not come as a surprise that the 2014 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to the scientists who, each in their own way, contributed to transforming super-resolution microscopy from a technological tour de force to a staple of the biologist's toolkit. By overcoming the diffraction barrier, light microscopy could once again be established as an indispensable tool in an age where the importance of understanding life at the molecular level cannot be overstated. This review strives to provide the aspiring life science researcher with an introduction to optical microscopy, starting from the fundamental concepts governing compound and fluorescent confocal microscopy to the current state-of-the-art of super-resolution microscopy techniques and their applications.},

We demonstrate that a relatively long, 2.5~{$\mu$}m, central wavelength of a few-cycle Cr2+:ZnS driving source (20~fs pulse duration, 6~W average power, 78~MHz repetition rate) enabled the use of highly nonlinear ZnGeP2 crystal for IDFG with exceptionally high conversion efficiency (\&gt;3\%) and output power of 0.15~W, with the spectral span of 5.8\textendash 12.5~{$\mu$}m. Even broader spectrum was achieved in GaSe crystal: 4.3\textendash 16.6~{$\mu$}m for type I and 5.8\textendash 17.6~{$\mu$}m for type II phase matching.

Here we describe the creation of vortex electron beams, making use of a versatile holographic reconstruction technique in a transmission electron microscope. This technique is a reproducible method of creating vortex electron beams in a conventional electron microscope. We demonstrate how they may be used in electron energy-loss spectroscopy to detect the magnetic state of materials and describe their properties. Our results show that electron vortex beams hold promise for new applications, in particular for analysing and manipulating nanomaterials, and can be easily produced.},

It is shown that the formation of prisms and needles is mainly determined by kinetic conditions with prisms favoured at lower temperatures ({$<$} 80 [degree]C), where faces can be developed from the solution complexes. The formation mechanism of the monodispersed prisms and needles occurs by coupling of microcrystalline spheres through their c axes forming embryonic rod particles which later grow. On the other hand, the formation of spherulitic aggregates is more the consequence of solution heterogeneity, i.e. high reactant concentrations.},

Range resolved data are acquired using both photon current and photon counts from a hybrid detection system. The DIAL measurements are performed using a repeating sequence of 10 frequencies spanning a range of 37.5 GHz near 1602.2 nm to sequentially sample CO2 and H2O at 10 Hz. Dry air mixing ratios of CO2 and H2O with a resolution of 250 m and an averaging time of 10 min resulted in uncertainties as low as 6 \&\#x00B5;mol/mol (ppm) and 0.44 g/kg, respectively. Simultaneous measurements using an integrated path differential absorption (IPDA) LIDAR system and in situ point sensor calibrated to WMO (World Meteorological Organization) gas standards are conducted over two 10 hr nighttime periods to support traceability of the DIAL results. The column averaged DIAL mixing ratios agree with the IPDA LIDAR results to within the measured uncertainties for much of two measurement periods. Some of the discrepancies with the in situ point sensor results are revealed through trends observed in the gradients of the range resolved DIAL data.},

  abstract = {We theoretically investigate the ionization of neonlike atoms by an intense ultrashort circularly polarized laser pulse as a function of wavelength, spanning the regime from single-photon ionization to multiphoton and tunneling ionization. In order to determine the dependence of the ionization probabilities on the magnetic quantum number of the initial state, we perform ab initio numerical calculations of the corresponding time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation in the single-active-electron approximation. Specific emphasis of our analysis is given to the intermediate-wavelength regime of about 50 nm to 300 nm, in which the trend in the ionization probability of counterrotating electrons strongly differs from those for electrons in the other two initial magnetic sublevels. Theoretical analysis and numerical results indicate that the enhanced emission of counterrotating electrons occurs via photon absorption channels, which are only accessible for electrons rotating opposite to the rotation direction of the external electric field. Physical mechanisms behind the enhancement are identified as threshold effects, in which the emission into continuum states with low angular momentum quantum numbers is favored, and resonant enhanced ionization involving transitions via specific excited states in the atom. Numerical results showing the strong population in the relevant excited states, specifically those with low angular momentum quantum number, for the ionization of counterrotating electrons, and the overall similar trends in ionization and excitation for electrons with the other two initial magnetic quantum numbers support our interpretation. Overall, these effects lead to a change in the ionization ratio of co- to counterrotating electrons by two orders of magnitude from 10:1 to 1:10. This strong selectivity in the emission of electrons may lead to new opportunities in the generation of ultrashort spin-polarized electron pulses.},

Specifically, by scanning the wavelength of an ultrafast tunable pump laser over a large range, we measure the second harmonic excitation spectra of these arrays and demonstrate their tunability with particle size and separation. Moreover, through a comparison with linear optical transmission spectra, which feature asymmetric Fano-type lineshapes, we demonstrate that the second harmonic generation is enhanced when coupled photonic\textendash plasmonic resonances of the arrays are excited at the fundamental pump wavelength, thus boosting the intensity of the electromagnetic near-fields. Our experimental results, which are supported by numerical simulations of linear optical transmission and near-field enhancement spectra based on the Finite Difference Time Domain method, demonstrate a direct correlation between the onset of Fano-type coupling and the enhancement of second harmonic generation in arrays of Au nanoparticles. Our findings enable the engineering of the nonlinear optical response of Fano-type coupled nanoparticle arrays that are relevant to a number of device applications in nonlinear nano-optics and plasmonics, such as on-chip frequency generators, modulators, switchers, and sensors.},

The simulation results indicate that the resonance wavelength and local field enhancement are greatly affected by the shape and size of the bowtie nanoantenna, as well as the relative permittivity and conductivity of the dielectric layer. The output current of the rectified nano-rectenna is substantially at nanoampere magnitude with an electric field intensity of 1 V/m. Moreover, the power conversion efficiency for devices with three different substrates illustrates that a substrate with a larger refractive index yields a higher efficiency and longer infrared response wavelength.

In this letter, we demonstrate that designer Babinet metasurfaces composed of C-aperture resonators offer a powerful control over the polarization state of the Smith-Purcell emission, which can hardly be achieved via traditional gratings. By coupling the intrinsically nonradiative energy bound at the source current sheet to the out-of-plane electric dipole and in-plane magnetic dipole of the C-aperture resonator, we are able to excite cross-polarized light thanks to the bianisotropic nature of the metasurface. The polarization direction of the emitted light is aligned with the orientation of the C-aperture resonator. Furthermore, the efficiency of the Smith-Purcell emission from Babinet metasurfaces is significantly increased by 84\%, in comparison with the case of conventional gratings. These findings not only open up a new way to manipulate the electron-beam-induced emission in the near-field region but also promise compact, tunable, and efficient light sources and particle detectors.},

Terahertz radiation bridges the gap between the microwave and optical regimes, and offers significant scientific and technological potential in many fields. However, waveguiding in this intermediate spectral region still remains a challenge. Neither conventional metal waveguides for microwave radiation, nor dielectric fibres for visible and near-infrared radiation can be used to guide terahertz waves over a long distance, owing to the high loss from the finite conductivity of metals or the high absorption coefficient of dielectric materials in this spectral range. Furthermore, the extensive use of broadband pulses in the terahertz regime imposes an additional constraint of low dispersion, which is necessary for compatibility with spectroscopic applications. Here we show how a simple waveguide, namely a bare metal wire, can be used to transport terahertz pulses with virtually no dispersion, low attenuation, and with remarkable structural simplicity. As an example of this new waveguiding structure, we demonstrate an endoscope for terahertz pulses.},

ZnO is ideal for nanogenerators for converting nano-scale mechanical energy into electricity owing to its coupled piezoelectric and semiconductive properties. The devices designed based on this coupled characteristic are the family of piezotronics, which is a new and unique group of electronic components that are controlled by external forces/pressure.},

The discrepancies between the time delays thus measured and those from many sophisticated theoretical calculations have generated a great deal of controversy in recent years. Here we present a careful examination of the methods that were used to retrieve the time delays and demonstrate the difficulty of achieving an accuracy of the retrieved time delays of a few to tens of attoseconds in typical streaking measurements. The difficulty owes more to the lower sensitivity of the streaking spectra to the phase of the photoionization transition dipole than to the spectral phase of the attosecond light pulse in the experiment. The retrieved time delay contains extra errors when the attochirp of the attosecond pulse is large so that the dipole phase becomes negligible compared to it.},

The unoccupied Ddown band has a local minimum at {$\Gamma\bar$} at 650{$\pm$}50 meV above the VBM and shows strong dispersion along the dimer rows of the c(4\texttimes 2) reconstructed surface. At 300 K the Ddown position shifts comparable to the Si conduction-band minimum by 40 meV to lower energies but the dispersion of the dangling-bond states is independent of temperature. The surface band bending for p-doped silicon is less than 30 meV, while acceptor-type defects cause significant and preparation-dependent band bending on n-doped samples. 2PPE spectra of Si(100) are dominated by interband transitions between the occupied and unoccupied surface states and emission out of transiently and permanently charged surface defects. Including electron\textendash hole interaction in many-body calculations of the quasi-particle band structure leads us to assign a dangling-bond split-off state to a quasi-one-dimensional surface exciton with a binding energy of 130 meV. Electrons resonantly excited to the unoccupied Ddown dangling-bond band with an excess energy of about 350 meV need 1.5{$\pm$}0.2 ps to scatter via phonon emission to the band bottom at {$\Gamma\bar$} and relax within 5 ps with an excited hole in the occupied surface band to form an exciton living for nanoseconds.},

An applied potential is utilized to enhance the nucleation process and achieve ZnO nanorods with a base diameter of 200 nm. The technique does not require a ZnO seed layer and can be carried out at temperatures as low as 70 C. Structural characterization of the as-grown ZnO nanorods has been investigated by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. This technique represents a new low-cost method for integrating ZnO nanorods into flexible electronic devices.},

We derive the mathematical formalism underlying the numerical method and introduce the Fourier-factorization suitable for nonlinear calculations. The numerical efficiency and runtime characteristics of the method are investigated in a set of benchmark calculations. The results corresponding to the fundamental frequency are compared to those obtained from a reference method and the beneficial effects of the modified Fourier-factorization rule on the accuracy of the nonlinear computations is demonstrated. To illustrate the capabilities of our method, we employ it to demonstrate strong enhancement of second-harmonic generationon one- and two-dimensional optical gratings resonantly coupled to a slab waveguide. Our method can be easily extended to other types of nonlinear optical interactions by simply incorporating the corresponding nonlinear polarization sources in the algorithm.},

Due to the large depth of focus of the Fresnel zone plates used as X-ray objectives, computed tomography based on the X-ray microscopic images can be used to reconstruct the local linear absorption coefficient inside the three-dimensional specimen volume. High-resolution X-ray images require a high specimen radiation dose, and a series of images taken at different viewing angles is needed for computed tomography. Therefore, cryo microscopy is necessary to preserve the structural integrity of hydrated biological specimens during image acquisition. The cryo transmission X-ray microscope at the electron storage ring BESSY I (Berlin) was used to obtain a tilt series of images of the frozen-hydrated green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The living specimens were inserted into borosilicate glass capillaries and, in this first experiment, rapidly cooled by plunging into liquid nitrogen. The capillary specimen holders allow image acquisition over the full angular range of 180\textdegree. The reconstruction shows for the first time details down to 60 nm size inside a frozen-hydrated biological specimen and conveys a clear impression of the internal structures. This technique is expected to be applicable to a wide range of biological specimens, such as the cell nucleus. It offers the possibility of imaging the three-dimensional structure of hydrated biological specimens close to their natural living state.},

Here, we conducted three tests of functional similarity between this amputee sprinter and competitive male runners with intact limbs: the metabolic cost of running, sprinting endurance, and running mechanics. Metabolic and mechanical data, respectively, were acquired via indirect calorimetry and ground reaction force measurement during constant-speed, level treadmill running. First, we found that the mean gross metabolic cost of transport of our amputee sprint subject (174.9 ml O2 kg-1 km-1; speeds: 2.5 to 4.1 m s-1) was only 3.8\% lower than mean values for intact-limb elite distance runners and 6.7\% lower than for sub-elite distance runners, but 17\% lower than for intact-limb 400-meter specialists (210.6 [13.2; SD] ml O2 kg-1 km-1). Second, the speeds our amputee sprinter maintained for six all-out, constant-speed trials to failure (speeds: 6.6-10.8 m s-1; durations: 2-90 s) were within 2.2 [0.6]\% of those predicted for intact-limb sprinters. Third, at sprinting speeds of 8.0, 9.0 and 10.0 m s-1, our amputee subject had longer foot-ground contact times (+14.7 [4.2]\%), shorter aerial (-26.4 [9.9]\%) and swing times (-15.2 [6.9]\%), and lower stance-averaged vertical forces (-19.3 [3.1]\%) than intact-limb sprinters (top speeds = 10.8 vs.10.8 [0.6] m s-1). We conclude that running on modern, lower-limb sprinting prostheses appears to be physiologically similar, but mechanically different than running with intact limbs.}

We observe noise suppression at up to three conductance quanta, with possible indications of current-induced local heating and 1/f noise in the contact region at high biases. These measurements demonstrate the quantum character of transport at room temperature at the atomic scale.

  abstract = {The operating speeds of the fastest electronic devices and integrated circuits (ICs) have surpassed the capabilities of conventional electronic measurement instrumentation. Electro-optic sampling is an optical probing technique which has ultrashort temporal resolution and is capable of noninvasively probing ICs at internal nodes. This technique is voltage-sensitive because it relies upon the electric field produced by the signal voltage on the device under test (DUT). The electric field (and hence the voltage) can be sampled because it produces birefringence in an electro-optic crystal which changes the state of polarization of an ultrashort-duration optical probe pulse that propagates through the electro-optic crystal. The electro-optic crystal is the substrate of the DUT for direct probing, is a crystal on a separate test structure for hybrid probing, and is a separate crystal placed above the DUT for external probing. Temporal resolution below 1 ps and a sensitivity below 0.1 mV/{$\surd$}Hz have been demonstrated (though not in the same experiment). The principles of electro-optic sampling are reviewed in this paper. Selected applications for measurement of high-speed waveforms in discrete devices and in ICs are presented.},

This implies that exciton fission occurs at a rate comparable to phonon-mediated exciton localization processes and may proceed directly from the initial, delocalized, state. The singlet population is identified due to the brief presence of stimulated emission, which is emitted at wavelengths which vary with the photon energy of the excitation pulse, a violation of Kasha's Rule that confirms that the lowest-lying singlet state is extremely short-lived. This direct demonstration that triplet generation is both rapid and efficient establishes multiple exciton generation by exciton fission as an attractive route to increased efficiency in organic solar cells.},

Here, we demonstrate the first single-shot CEP measurement of intense few-cycle laser pulses. We focus a laser pulse on a gas target and detect photoelectrons emitted in opposing directions (`left\textendash right') parallel to the polarization of the laser. By comparing the left\textendash right asymmetries of photoelectrons at different energies, we mapped the CEP of consecutive non-phase-stabilized pulses on a parametric plot. This new evaluation method enables us to determine the CEP without phase ambiguity at unprecedented measurement precision. Future investigation of phase-dependent phenomena with CEP tagging at a much lower phase jitter than accessible at present with phase-stabilized lasers is now possible.},

  abstract = {Fundamental quantum electrodynamical (QED) processes such as spontaneous emission and electron-photon scattering encompass a wealth of phenomena that form one of the cornerstones of modern science and technology. Conventionally, calculations in QED and in other field theories assume that incoming particles are single-momentum states. The possibility that coherent superposition states, i.e. "shaped wavepackets", will alter the result of fundamental scattering processes is thereby neglected, and is instead assumed to sum to an incoherent (statistical) distribution in the incoming momentum. Here, we show that free-electron wave-shaping can be used to engineer quantum interferences that alter the results of scattering processes in QED. Specifically, the interference of two or more pathways in a QED process (such as photon emission) enables precise control over the rate of that process. As an example, we apply our concept to Bremsstrahlung, a ubiquitous phenomenon that occurs, for instance, in X-ray sources for state-of-the-art medical imaging, security scanning, materials analysis, and astrophysics. We show that free electron wave-shaping can be used to tailor both the spatial and the spectral distribution of emitted photons, enhancing their directionality and monochromaticity, and adding more degrees of freedom that make emission processes like Bremsstrahlung more versatile. The ability to tailor the spatiotemporal attributes of photon emission via quantum interference provides a new degree of freedom in shaping radiation across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. More broadly, the ability to tailor general QED processes through the shaping of free electrons opens up new avenues of control in processes ranging from optical excitation processes (e.g., plasmon and phonon emission) in electron microscopy to free electron lasing in the quantum regime.},

Here, we propose a highly directional, tunable and monochromatic radiation source based on electrons interacting with graphene plasmons. Our complementary analytical theory and ab initio simulations demonstrate that the high momentum of the strongly confined graphene plasmons enables the generation of high-frequency radiation from relatively low-energy electrons, bypassing the need for lengthy electron acceleration stages or extreme laser intensities. For instance, highly directional 20\hspace{0.25em}keV photons could be generated in a table-top design using electrons from conventional radiofrequency electron guns. The conductive nature and high damage threshold of graphene make it especially suitable for this application. Our electron\textendash plasmon scattering theory is readily extended to other systems in which free electrons interact with surface waves.},

We show that it is possible experimentally to reconstruct the atomic-resolution complex image (exit-face wavefunction) of a small particle lying on a thin carbon substrate from its electron microdiffraction pattern alone. We use a modified iterative charge-flipping algorithm and an estimate of the complex substrate image is subtracted at each iteration. The diffraction pattern is recorded using a parallel beam with a diameter of 50 nm, illuminating a gold nanoparticle of 13.6 nm diameter. Prior knowledge of the boundary of the object is not required. The method has the advantage that the reconstructed exit-face wavefunction is free of the aberrations of the objective lens normally used in the microscope, whereas resolution is limited only by thermal vibration and noise.},

The high-field concentration of SPP greatly enhanced the second-harmonic generation (SHG) over a short traveling distance.

  abstract = {On the basis of three-dimensional continuity equation in semiconductors and finite difference method, the carrier concentration and the quantum efficiency of GaN wire photocathode as a function of incident photon energy are achieved. Results show that the quantum efficiency of the wire photocathode is largely enhanced compared with the conventional wafer photocathode. The superiority of the wire photocathode is reflected in its structure with surrounding surfaces. The quantum efficiency of the wire photocathode largely depends on the wire diameter, surface reflectivity, surface escape probability and incident angle of light. The back interface recombination rate, however, has little influences on the quantum efficiency of the wire photocathode. The simulation results suggest that the optimal diameter for photoemission is 150\textasciitilde 200 nm. Besides, the quantum efficiency increases and decreases linearly with increasing surface escape probability and surface reflectivity, respectively. With increasing ratio of wire spacing to wire height, the optimal incident angle of light is reduced. These simulations are expected to guide the preparation of a better performing GaN wire photocathode.},
  note = {My Comments:
\par
The paper, entitled "Research on quantum efficiency of GaN wire photocathode", presents simulations of the quantum efficiency of GaN wires fabricated on a GaN substrate. Both single wires and arrays of wires are considered under various illumination conditions and with varying structural dimensions. While the content is timely and useful to the community, I find that there are several issues that must be addressed before recommending for publication. Most significantly is the first issue of electromagnetic modeling. ~

1. Electromagnetic Modeling

The optical simulations appear too simple to me to be applicable on such dimensions.~ For instance, you find an optimal wire width of around 150-200 nm which is less than the wavelength of the incident light, but use bulk reflectivity to determine absorption.~ Isn't this oversimplified?~ For a nanostructure, more detailed electromagnetic simulation should be performed to determine absorption as the reflectivity from a planar film should no longer be applicable. ~

I see this again with thhe analysis of the wire array.~ I feel that at such dimensions and spacing (1500 nm spacing, 1000 nm height), it is innacurate to use geometric optics for the analysis, which appears to be what was done.~ By not accounting for accurate electrometic simulation of the structures presented, and, thus, accurate absorption, it feels misleading to then compare quantum efficiency between the wire and the surface where the absorption is used as a critical term.~ Furthermore, as this has been submitted to Applied Optics, and does not have experimental results to justify the model directly, I feel that it is very important more accurate optical modeling be used.

2. Definition of S (Eqn. 6)

In equation 6, you point to the area of the incident plane of light.~ I feel this has not adequately been defined.~ Is it the cross section of the structure as seen by the light?~ It is important to note this as one must consider that they cannot be packed infinitely close together.

3. In Figure 1, I would suggest labeling the parts (a), (b), (c).~ This would make referencing clearer in the text.~ Also, the carrier concentration plot labels are unreadable and should be made larger/clearer. Also, in the caption do you mean sketch not ketch?

4. I feel the use of the word diameter is misleading as you use a square cross section for the wire.~ Perhaps width instead of diameter.

5. On the bottom-left of page one do you mean respectively instead of respected? 

6. In general, the paper has many English mistakes and should be reviewed by a native speaker for clarity and correct word usage (similar to point 5 above, but I do not mark all of them here).},

We find that the width of the harmonic plateau can be extended when a static electric field is added in the y component. We also investigate emission time of harmonics in terms of a time-frequency analysis to illustrate the physical mechanism of high-order harmonic generation. We calculate the ionization rate using the Ammosov-Delone-Krainov model and interpret the variation of harmonic intensity for different static electric field strengths. When the ratio of strengths of the static and the y-component laser fields is 0.1, a continuous harmonic spectrum is formed from 220 to 420 eV. By superposing a properly selected range of the harmonic spectrum from 300 to 350 eV, an isolated attosecond pulse with a duration of about 75 as is obtained, which is near linearly polarized.},

  abstract = {The problem of highly nonlinear photoemission from a metal surface is considered using analytical and numerical approaches. Descriptions are found which cover both the weak-field and the strong-field regimes and the transition between them. The results of a time-dependent perturbation theory are in very good agreement with those from more numerically involved schemes, including a variational version of the Floquet method and a Crank-Nicolson-like numerical scheme. The implemented Crank-Nicolson variant uses transparent boundary conditions and an incident plane-wave state in the metal. Both numerical approaches give very similar results for weak and intermediate fields, while in the strong-field regime the Crank-Nicolson scheme is more effective than the Floquet method. We find an enhancement in the effective nonlinearity in the weak-field regime, which is caused by surface scattering of the final state. The presented theory also covers angular emission probabilities as a function of light intensity and explains an increase toward forward emission with growing field strength.},

We observe strong modulations in the dispersion curves of Smith-Purcell radiation (SPR) when they intersect the surface plasmons of silver gratings using a 200-kV transmission electron microscope. The decay of the plasmons away from the grating is directly probed by controlling the electron-beam position relative to the sample surface with nanometer precision. Our measurements are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations, clearly revealing the presence of characteristic Fano profiles resulting from the interference of the light continuum and the discrete plasmon states for each direction of emission. The intensity anomaly in the SPR emission pattern can be well explained from the geometrical consideration of the intersections between the dispersion planes of the SPR and surface plasmon polariton (SPP). A strong and directional SPR beam can be realized under the condition that the SPR dispersion plane comes in contact with the band edge of the SPP dispersion plane.},

Strongly asymmetric field-emission intensity distributions are observed depending on three parameters: (1) the polarization of the light, (2) the azimuthal and (3) the polar orientation of the tip apex relative to the laser incidence direction. In effect, we have realized an ultrafast pulsed field-emission source with site selectivity of a few tens of nanometers. Simulations of local fields on the tip apex and of electron emission patterns based on photo-excited nonequilibrium electron distributions explain our observations quantitatively. Electron emission processes are found to depend on laser power and tip voltage. At relatively low laser power and high tip voltage, field-emission after two-photon photo-excitation is the dominant process. At relatively low laser power and low tip voltage, photoemission processes are dominant. As the laser power increases, photoemission from the tip shank becomes noticeable.},

Dose variations associated with charging, electron source instability, optical system drift, and ultimately shot noise in the e-beam itself conspire to critical dimension variability, line width/edge roughness, and limited throughput. It would be an important improvement to e-beam based patterning technology if real-time feedback control of electron-dose were provided so that pattern quality and throughput would be improved beyond the shot noise limit. In this paper, we demonstrate control of e-beam dose based on the measurement of electron arrival at the sample where patterns are written, rather than from the source or another point in the electron optical column. Our results serve as the first steps towards real-time dose control and eventually overcoming the shot noise.},

  abstract = {We theoretically investigated electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) of ultraviolet surface plasmon modes in aluminum nanodisks. Using full-wave Maxell electromagnetic simulations, we studied the impact of the diameter on the resonant modes of the nanodisks. We found that the mode behavior can be separately classified for two distinct cases: (1) flat nanodisks where the diameter is much larger than the thickness and (2) thick nanodisks where the diameter is comparable to the thickness. While the multipolar edge modes and breathing modes of flat nanostructures have previously been interpreted using intuitive, analytical models based on surface plasmon polariton (SPP) modes of a thin-film stack, it has been found that the true dispersion relation of the multipolar edge modes deviates significantly from the SPP dispersion relation. Here, we developed a modified intuitive model that uses effective wavelength theory to accurately model this dispersion relation with significantly less computational overhead compared to full-wave Maxwell electromagnetic simulations. However, for the case of thick nanodisks, this effective wavelength theory breaks down, and such intuitive models are no longer viable. We found that this is because some modes of the thick nanodisks carry a polar (i.e., out of the substrate plane or along the electron beam direction) dependence and cannot be simply categorized as radial breathing modes or angular (azimuthal) multipolar edge modes. This polar dependence leads to radiative losses, motivating the use of simultaneous EELS and cathodoluminescence measurements when experimentally investigating the complex mode behavior of thick nanostructures.},

Recently, HHG has also been reported in solids, providing novel opportunities such as controlling strong-field and attosecond processes in dense optical media down to the nanoscale2. Here, we report HHG from a low-loss, indium-doped cadmium oxide thin film by leveraging the epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) effect3\textendash 8, whereby the real part of the material's permittivity in certain spectral ranges vanishes, as well as the associated large resonant enhancement of the driving laser field. We find that ENZ-assisted harmonics exhibit a pronounced spectral redshift as well as linewidth broadening, resulting from the photo induced electron heating and the consequent time-dependent ENZ wavelength of the material. Our results provide a new platform to study strong-field and ultrafast electron dynamics in ENZ materials, reveal new degrees of freedom for spectral and temporal control of HHG, and open up the possibilities of compact solid-state attosecond light sources.},

Following the numerical simulation for the UV projection scanning exposure of thick SU-8 photoresist, experiment results are demonstrated for different exposure strategies. With Continually Changing Focus Projection Scanning (CCFPS), SU-8 microstructures with 860 {$\mu$}m high and 15 {$\mu$}m feature size are demonstrated. For microstructure with 866 {$\mu$}m height, 20 {$\mu$}m width, from the top layer to the bottom layer, the dimension can be controlled in the range of +0.7 to -1.7 {$\mu$}m; also, the vertical sidewall angle can be controlled inside 90 {$\pm$} 0.16\textdegree. It approves that the CCFPS exposure for HARMS can achieve much straighter and more vertical sidewall compared with UV contact print or UV projection exposure with focusing image on the resist surface or an optimized depth.},

We found the phase plates could produce a null in the center of the bright-field based on coherent interference of diffractive beams. Our work adds capabilities to the fabrication of electron phase plates. The nullification of the direct beam and the tunable diffraction efficiency demonstrated here also paves the way towards novel dark-field electron-microscopy techniques.},

In ultrafast electron microscopy, the electrons are accelerated, typically to 200 keV, and the microscope operates in the transmission mode. Here, we report the development of scanning ultrafast electron microscopy using a field-emission-source configuration. Scanning of pulses is made in the single-electron mode, for which the pulse contains at most one or a few electrons, thus achieving imaging without the space-charge effect between electrons, and still in ten(s) of seconds. For imaging, the secondary electrons from surface structures are detected, as demonstrated here for material surfaces and biological specimens. By recording backscattered electrons, diffraction patterns from single crystals were also obtained. Scanning pulsed-electron microscopy with the acquired spatiotemporal resolutions, and its efficient heat-dissipation feature, is now poised to provide in situ 4D imaging and with environmental capability.},

This paper develops a new device processing method named "Soft-Lithographic Lift-Off and Grafting (SLLOG)" to fabricate the previously designed PDMS-on-silicon hybrid actuator structure. SLLOG is a low-temperature (less than 150\textdegree C) process that allows replica molded PDMS microstructures to be integrated in silicon micromachined device patterns. The fabricated actuator is characterized using laser vibrometry. The experimental results demonstrate actuation motions achieved in three independent axes with fast dynamic response reaching a bandwidth of about 5 kHz. The fabricated PDMS-on-silicon actuator yields a vertical displacement up to 5 {$\mu$}m and rotational motions with a 0.6-\textdegree{} tilting angle at a 40-V peak-to-peak ac actuation voltage.},

The electronic couplings and the rates of exciton dissociation and charge recombination have been evaluated for several geometrical configurations of the pentacene/C60 complex, which are relevant to bilayer and bulk heterojunctions. The results suggest that, irrespective of the actual pentacene-fullerene orientation, both pentacene-based and C60-based excitons are able to dissociate efficiently. Also, in the case of parallel configurations of the molecules at the pentacene/C60 interface, the decay of the lowest charge-transfer state to the ground state is calculated to be very fast; as a result, it can compete with the dissociation process into mobile charge carriers. Since parallel configurations are expected to be found more frequently in bulk heterojunctions than in bilayer heterojunctions, the performance of pentacene/C60 bulk-heterojunction solar cells is likely to be more affected by charge recombination than that of bilayer devices.},

Typically performed in atomic gases, there is now interest in extending such a process to the solid state. Yoshikawa et al. pumped single-layer graphene with intense polarized pulses of infrared light to generate ultraviolet light, up to the ninth harmonic. Theoretical analysis of the process suggests that the effect could be transferred to other solid-state systems, providing a possible route to develop coherent light sources across the spectrum. Science, this issue p. 736 The electronic properties of graphene can give rise to a range of nonlinear optical responses. One of the most desirable nonlinear optical processes is high-harmonic generation (HHG) originating from coherent electron motion induced by an intense light field. Here, we report on the observation of up to ninth-order harmonics in graphene excited by mid-infrared laser pulses at room temperature. The HHG in graphene is enhanced by an elliptically polarized laser excitation, and the resultant harmonic radiation has a particular polarization. The observed ellipticity dependence is reproduced by a fully quantum mechanical treatment of HHG in solids. The zero-gap nature causes the unique properties of HHG in graphene, and our findings open up the possibility of investigating strong-field and ultrafast dynamics and nonlinear behavior of massless Dirac fermions. High-harmonic generation is observed in single-layer graphene. High-harmonic generation is observed in single-layer graphene.},

Recently, high-harmonic generation has been observed in solids, which could lead to important applications such as all-optical methods to image valance charge density and reconstruct electronic band structures, as well as compact extreme ultraviolet light sources. So far these studies are confined to crystalline solids; therefore, decoupling the respective roles of long-range periodicity and high density has been challenging. Here we report the observation of high-harmonic generation from amorphous fused silica. We decouple the role of long-range periodicity by comparing harmonics generated from fused silica and crystalline quartz, which contain the same atomic constituents but differ in long-range periodicity. Our results advance current understanding of the strong-field processes leading to high-harmonic generation in solids with implications for the development of robust and compact extreme ultraviolet light sources.},

It is found that characterized by surface plasmon resonance, highly localized field are found in the gap between the two components of the bow-tie nanoantenna. In addition, such field enhancement is observed to be dependent on the geometric effects, such as the angle and the tip size of the apex, the spacing and the length.

We demonstrate the indirect coherent reconstruction of THz temporal waveforms at each spatial position of an object, without the need of mechanical raster-scanning. First, we exploit such temporal information to realize (far-field) time-of-flight images. In addition, as a proof of concept, we apply a typical compressive sensing algorithm to demonstrate image reconstruction with less than 50\% of the total required measurements. Finally, the access to frequency domain is also demonstrated by reconstructing spectral images of an object featuring an absorption line in the THz range. The combination of single-pixel imaging with compressive sensing algorithms allows to reduce both complexity and acquisition time of current THz-TDS imaging systems.},

We find that the introduction of a permanent dipole moment leads to an enhanced coupling of Frenkel exciton and charge transfer states and to an increased SF rate which we probed using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. These findings are contrasted with H-aggregate formation and a significantly reduced triplet-pair state lifetime in a fluorinated pentacene for which the different partial charge distribution leads to a negligible dipole moment.},

However, these efforts have been hampered by unfavorable experimental conditions, such as cryogenic temperatures and ultrahigh vacuum, required to study such systems and phenomena. Although several attempts to realize strong light-matter interactions at room temperature using plasmon resonances have been made, successful realizations on the single-nanoparticle level are still lacking. Here, we demonstrate the strong coupling between plasmons confined within a single silver nanoprism and excitons in molecular J aggregates at ambient conditions. Our findings show that deep subwavelength mode volumes V together with quality factors Q that are reasonably high for plasmonic nanostructures result in a strong-coupling figure of merit\textendash Q/{$\surd$}V as high as {$\sim$}6\texttimes 103 {$\mu$}m-3/2, a value comparable to state-of-the-art photonic crystal and microring resonator cavities.

The electron microscope's ability to resolve three-dimensional (3D) structures on the atomic scale is continuing to affect different fields, including materials science and biology. In this Review, we highlight recent developments and inventions made by introducing the fourth dimension of time in electron microscopy. Today, ultrafast electron microscopy (4D UEM) enables a resolution that is 10 orders of magnitude better than that of conventional microscopes, which are limited by the video-camera rate of recording. After presenting the central concept involved, that of single-electron stroboscopic imaging, we discuss prototypical applications, which include the visualization of complex structures when unfolding on different length and time scales. The developed UEM variant techniques are several, and here we illucidate convergent-beam and near-field imaging, as well as tomography and scanning-pulse microscopy. We conclude with current explorations in imaging of nanomaterials and biostructures and an outlook on possible future directions in space-time, 4D electron microscopy.},

We develop a suite of methods to fulfill these requirements and acquire atomic-resolution TEM images of several metal organic frameworks that are generally recognized as highly sensitive to electron beams. The high image resolution allows us to identify individual metal atomic columns, various types of surface termination, and benzene rings in the organic linkers.

A simple analytical dispersion relation is derived to predict the frequency of the evanescent surface wave of the open grating, which is excited by a backward-wave oscillation mechanism and emits radiation at harmonics of this frequency, and the cavity mode frequencies of the Orotron-like device, all in excellent agreement with the simulation data. The grating parameters are optimized to minimize the starting current of a continuous electron beam for exciting coherent SPR. It is demonstrated that a prebunched beam can be used to selectively excite coherent SPR at desired SPR angle and frequencies that are higher harmonics of the beam bunching frequency, where the starting current requirement is eliminated. Our PIC simulations show the dynamics of modes development and competition for the Orotron-like open cavity structure, which owns a lower starting current than the surface mode process. This oscillation mode dominates at steady state and enhances the radiated power by more than 2 orders of magnitude.},

Great progress has been made so far thanks to the efforts of many scientists in           developing the photoemission sources and beam blankers needed to create short pulses of           electrons for the UEM experiments. While details on these setups have typically been           reported, a systematic overview of methods used to obtain a pulsed beam and a comparison           of relevant source parameters have not yet been conducted. In this report, we outline the           basic requirements and parameters that are important for UEM. Different types of imaging           modes in UEM are analyzed and summarized. After reviewing and analyzing the different           kinds of photoemission sources and beam blankers that have been reported in the           literature, we estimate the reduced brightness for all the photoemission sources reviewed           and compare this to the brightness in the continuous and blanked beams. As for the problem           of pulse broadening caused by the repulsive forces between electrons, four main methods           available to mitigate the dispersion are summarized. We anticipate that the analysis and           conclusions provided in this manuscript will be instructive for designing an UEM setup and           could thus push the further development of UEM.},

However, because the involved nonlinear medium is a partially ionized gas, traditional approaches for phase-matching the conversion process are not applicable. This severely limits the flux from this source. Here, we demonstrate the first use of a train of counterpropagating light pulses to enhance high-harmonic emission. This all-optical quasi-phase-matching technique uses interfering beams to scramble the quantum phase of the generated short-wavelength light, to suppress emission from out-of-phase regions. Selective enhancement of more than 300 is observed at photon energies around 70\,eV in argon gas. Finally, we show that by adjusting the intensity of the counterpropagating light, different electron quantum trajectories can be selectively enhanced, demonstrating attosecond-timescale coherent control of the radiating electron wavefunction.},

In this paper, four different methods of generating multi-mode NOON states with a high photon number were proposed. The first method is a linear optical approach that makes use of the Fock state filtration to reduce lower-order Fock state terms from the coherent state inputs, which are jointly combined to produce a multi-mode NOON state with the triggering of multi-fold single-photon coincidence detections (SPCD) and appropriate postselection. The other three methods (two linear and one nonlinear) use N-photon Fock states as the inputs and require SPCD triggering only. All of the four methods can theoretically create a multi-mode NOON state with an arbitrary photon number. Comparisons among these four methods were made with respect to their feasibility and efficiency. The first method is experimentally most feasible since it takes considerably fewer photonic operations and, more importantly, requires neither the use of high-N Fock states nor high-degree of nonlinearity.},

  abstract = {Attosecond pulses in the soft x-ray (SXR) to water-window energy region offer the tools for creating and studying target-specific localized inner-shell electrons or holes in materials, enabling monitoring or controlling charge and energy flows in a dynamic system on attosecond timescales. Recently, a number of laboratories have reported generation of continuum harmonics in the hundred-electron-volt to kilovolt region with few-cycle long-wavelength mid-infrared lasers. These harmonics have the bandwidth to support pulses with durations of a few to a few-ten attoseconds. But harmonics generated in a gas medium have attochirps that cannot be fully compensated by materials over a broad spectral range; thus, realistically what are the typical shortest attosecond pulses that one can generate? To answer this question, it is essential that the temporal attosecond pulses be accurately characterized. By reanalyzing the soft x-ray attosecond metrology reported in three recent experiments [Li et al. 53-attosecond x-ray pulses reach the carbon K-edge, Nat. Commun. 8, 186 (2017); Gaumnitz et al. Streaking of 43-attosecond soft x-ray pulses generated by a passively CEP-stable mid-infrared driver, Opt. Exp. 25, 27506 (2017); Cousin et al. Attosecond Streaking in the Water Window: A New Regime of Attosecond Pulse Characterization, Phys. Rev. X 7, 041030 (2017)] using a newly developed broadband phase retrieval algorithm, we demonstrate that the generated attosecond pulses in the first two papers have durations of about 60 as, longer than what they have reported. Similarly, the duration from the third experiment is retrieved to be about half of the 322-as upper limit cited in that work. We also introduce the autocorrelation (AC) of the streaking spectrogram. By comparing the ACs from the experiments and from the retrieved SXR pulses, the accuracy of the retrieved results can be directly visualized. Our retrieval method is fast and accurate, and it shall provide a powerful tool for the metrology of the emerging few-ten-attosecond pulses.},

Meanwhile, the asymmetrical line shape and the resonant wavelength can be easily tuned by changing the parameters of the structure. By adding stubs on the groove, we gained the multiple Fano resonances.

However, in a vast area of strong-field optical science, the borderline between perturbative and nonperturbative nonlinear optics is defined as \&\#x03B3; \textasciitilde 1, where \&\#x03B3; is the Keldysh parameter. Not only is this criterion frequency-dependent, in a stark contrast with E/Eat \textasciitilde 1, but it also often dictates much weaker fields at which the perturbative treatment is still valid, leading to a dramatic shrinkage in the convergence radius of perturbation-theory expansions. Here, we identify the physics behind the gap between the E/Eat \textasciitilde 1 and \&\#x03B3; \textasciitilde 1 conditions as the limits of perturbative nonlinear optics. We argue that, while the criterion E/Eat \&lt;\&lt; 1 sets a universal upper-bound limit on the validity of perturbative nonlinear optics and its central concept of nonlinear-optical susceptibilities, optical nonlinearities related to photoionization pathways become nonperturbative in much weaker optical fields, with the limits of a perturbative treatment defined by the Keldysh parameter \&\#x03B3; rather than the E/Eat ratio.},

The electromechanical sensor device consists of a single electrically connected PFW that is placed on the outer surface of a flexible polystyrene (PS) substrate and bonded at its two ends. The entire device is fully packaged by a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) thin layer. The PFW has Schottky contacts at its two ends but with distinctly different barrier heights. The I{$\dottedsquare$}V characteristic is highly sensitive to strain mainly due to the change in Schottky barrier height (SBH), which scales linear with strain. The change in SBH is suggested owing to the strain induced band structure change and piezoelectric effect. The experimental data can be well-described by the thermionic emission{$\dottedsquare$}diffusion model. A gauge factor of as high as 1250 has been demonstrated, which is 25\% higher than the best gauge factor demonstrated for carbon nanotubes.

Transmissive metasurfaces, with full 2{$\pi$} phase control, are a particularly attractive platform for replacing conventional optical elements due to their small footprint and broad functionality. However, the operational bandwidth of metasurfaces has been a critical limitation and is directly connected to either their resonant response or the diffractive dispersion of their lattice. While multiwavelength and continuous band operation have been demonstrated, the elements suffer from either low efficiency, reduced imaging quality, or limited element size. Here, we propose a platform that provides for multiwavelength operation by employing tightly spaced multilayer dielectric metasurfaces. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate a multiwavelength metalens doublet (NA = 0.42) with focusing efficiencies of 38\% and 52\% at wavelengths of 1180 and 1680 nm, respectively. We further show how this approach can be extended to three-wavelength metalenses as well as a spectral splitter. This approach could find applications in fluorescent microscopy, digital imaging, and color routing.},

However, previous dielectric, few-layer designs only achieved moderate asymmetry ratios, and a fundamental understanding of bounds on asymmetric radiation from arbitrary structures is still lacking. Here, we show that breaking the 180\&\#x00B0; rotational symmetry of the structure is crucial for achieving highly asymmetric radiation. We develop a general temporal coupled-mode theory formalism to derive bounds on the asymmetric decay rates to the top and bottom of a photonic crystal slab for a resonance with arbitrary in-plane wavevector. Guided by this formalism, we show that infinite asymmetry is still achievable even without the need for back-reflection mirrors, and we provide numerical examples of designs that achieve asymmetry ratios exceeding 104. The emission direction can also be rapidly switched from top to bottom by tuning the wavevector or frequency. Furthermore, we show that with the addition of weak material absorption loss, such structures can be used to achieve perfect absorption with single-sided illumination, even for single-pass material absorption rates less than 0.5\% and without back-reflection mirrors. Our work provides new design principles for achieving highly directional radiation and perfect absorption in photonics.},

  abstract = {We report the observation and systematic investigation of the space charge effect and mirror charge effect in photoemission spectroscopy. When pulsed light is incident on a sample, the photo-emitted electrons experience energy redistribution after escaping from the surface because of the Coulomb interaction between them (space charge effect) and between photo-emitted electrons and the distribution of mirror charges in the sample (mirror charge effect). These combined Coulomb interaction effects give rise to an energy shift and a broadening which can be on the order of 10 meV for a typical third-generation synchrotron light source. This value is comparable to many fundamental physical parameters actively studied by photoemission spectroscopy and should be taken seriously in interpreting photoemission data and in designing next generation experiments.},

The planar structure of the geometric diode provides a low RC time constant, on the order of 10-15 s, required for operation at optical frequencies, and a low impedance for efficient power transfer from the antenna. Fabricated geometric diodes show asymmetric current\textendash voltage characteristics consistent with Monte Carlo simulations for the devices.

Exploiting timing logic, we demonstrate a sixteen-element detector that resolves all 136 possible single-photon and two-photon coincidence events. We further explore the pulse shapes of the detector output and resolve up to four-photon events in a four-element device, giving the detector photon-number-resolving capability. This new detector architecture and operating scheme will be particularly useful for multi-photon coincidence detection in large-scale photonic integrated circuits.},

Here we present experiments on strong-field excitation in both the tunneling and multiphoton regimes and their rigorous interpretation by time dependent Schr\"odinger equation calculations, which finally consolidates the seemingly opposing strong-field regimes with their complementary pictures. Most strikingly, we observe an unprecedented enhancement of excitation yields, which opens new possibilities in ultrafast strong-field control of Rydberg wave packet excitation and laser intensity characterization.},

Electrically connected arrays of plasmonic nanoantennas make possible the realization of novel photonic devices, including optical sensors and rectifiers. Although the plasmonic response of unconnected arrays has been studied extensively, the present study shows that the inclusion of nanowire connections modifies the device response significantly. After presenting experimental measurements of optical extinction for unconnected dimer arrays, we compare these to measurements of dimers that are interconnected by gold nanowire ``busbars.'' The connected devices show the familiar dipole response associated with the unconnected dimers but also show a second localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) that we refer to as the ``coupled-busbar mode.'' Our experimental study also demonstrates that the placement of the nanowire along the antenna modifies the LSPR. Using finite-difference time-domain simulations, we confirm the experimental results and investigate the variation of dimer gap and spacing. Changing the dimer gap in connected devices has a significantly smaller effect on the dipole response than it does in unconnected devices. On the other hand, both LSPR modes respond strongly to changing the spacing between devices in the direction along the interconnecting wires. We also give results for the variation of E-field strength in the dimer gap, which will be important for any working sensor or rectenna device.},

Organic photovoltaic devices based on the SF process have shown great potential in solar energy conversion to exceed Shockley-Queisser limit. The key to SF photovoltaic devices requires efficient electron transfer (ET) from triplet exciton after SF, which is yet to be thoroughly investigated. Here, we performed thorough photophysical studies in 6,13-Bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)pentacene (TIPS-pentacene)/C60 heterostructures using TIPS-pentacene microsize single crystal as a well-defined model system. We show the SF process in TIPS-pentacene single crystal occurs by a two-step process, with triplet pair intermediates forming in 75 fs and then dissociating to non-interacting triplets in 1.6 ps. The SF process in single crystal is comparable to that in polycrystalline film. Importantly, we observe a considerable fraction of singlet excitons is quenched by ultrafast ({$<$}75 fs) interfacial ET prior to fission and no ET from triplet excitons in 1.5 ns time window. We confirm that the absence of ET is not limited by exciton diffusion but due to very slow ({$\gg$}1.5 ns) interfacial ET from triplet exciton. The observations contradict expected singlet and triplet ET behaviors based on a simple two-state Marcus ET model and suggest long-range interfacial ET from delocalized photoexcitation. The ultrafast ET from singlet exciton before SF and slow ET from triplet exciton call for reconsideration and careful design of efficient SF photovoltaic devices.},

In particular, when a weak dc electric field is applied, we prove that the phase shifts of all harmonics linearly depend on the dc field strength. In addition, when an ultrastrong static magnetic field is applied collinearly with the driving laser polarization, harmonic generation efficiency is enhanced and higher harmonics beyond the usual ``cutoff'' are generated as a result of the squeezing of the transversely spreading electron wave packets. The enhancement is a confirmation of the electron-ion recollision mechanism for high-order harmonic generation.},

  abstract = {The emergence of the classical world from the quantum substrate of our Universe is a long-standing conundrum. In this paper, I describe three insights into the transition from quantum to classical that are based on the recognition of the role of the environment. I begin with the derivation of preferred sets of states that help to define what exists\textemdash our everyday classical reality. They emerge as a result of the breaking of the unitary symmetry of the Hilbert space which happens when the unitarity of quantum evolutions encounters nonlinearities inherent in the process of amplification\textemdash of replicating information. This derivation is accomplished without the usual tools of decoherence, and accounts for the appearance of quantum jumps and the emergence of preferred pointer states consistent with those obtained via environment-induced superselection, or einselection. The pointer states obtained in this way determine what can happen\textemdash define events\textemdash without appealing to Born's Rule for probabilities. Therefore, pk=|{$\psi$}k|2 can now be deduced from the entanglement-assisted invariance, or envariance\textemdash a symmetry of entangled quantum states. With probabilities at hand, one also gains new insights into the foundations of quantum statistical physics. Moreover, one can now analyse the information flows responsible for decoherence. These information flows explain how the perception of objective classical reality arises from the quantum substrate: the effective amplification that they represent accounts for the objective existence of the einselected states of macroscopic quantum systems through the redundancy of pointer state records in their environment\textemdash through quantum Darwinism.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue `Foundations of quantum mechanics and their impact on contemporary society'.},
