# Short Cable Impedance -- T-Line vs. Lumped Element Approximation

## Description

This note examines two approaches to approximating the impedance of a short coax cable.

 1. The transmission-line approach
 2. The lumped element approach

It shows that both are the same in the limit of a short cable.

However, the transmission-line approach is more general.

Since it is just as easy and straightforward, I don't see why you shouldn't always calculate impedance using the transmission-line approach.
