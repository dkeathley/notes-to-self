*Description*

In this note I derive the mode dispersion for surface plasmon polaritons traveling along a planar interface.  While the focus is eventually on surface plasmon modes, the analysis follows a generalized approach that I find helpful in thinking about electromagnetic modes at interfaces.

*Topics/Key Words*

1. surface plasmon polaritons
2. electromagnetic modes
3. interfaces

* Kramers-Kronig Analysis and Refractive Index of Hemoglobin/Red Blood Cells :ATTACH:kramers:kronig:drude:lorentz:fit:

*[[./PROJECT-ATTACHMENTS/knowledge/NOTE-hemoglobin-refractive-index-vis-nir-2022-04-04-13-04/note.org][Note]]*

*Description*

This note was developed as I wanted to find a method for calculating the refractive index of biological materials for a project. The focus of this note is particularly on calculating the refractive index of hemoglobin/red blood cells, however it can be applied in general to a host of materials where extinction spectra are known.

*Topics/Key Words*

1. optical properties of hemoglobin
2. oxygenated vs. de-oxygenated hemoglobin
3. Kramers-Kronig analysis

*Description*

This note examines two approaches to approximating the impedance of a short coax cable.

 1. The transmission-line approach
 2. The lumped element approach

It shows that both are the same in the limit of a short cable.

However, the transmission-line approach is more general.

Since it is just as easy and straightforward, I don't see why you shouldn't always calculate impedance using the transmission-line approach.

*Topics/Key Words*

1. impedance
2. transmission lines
3. electromagnetics
